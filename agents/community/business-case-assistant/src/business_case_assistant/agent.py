            ## How It Works
            The user enters the key points or objectives of their business case. If the agent needs more information, it will ask the user follow up questions until it 
            has gathered enough information to create a comprehensive business case document. Once it decides that it has gathered enough information,
            a business case document will be generated containing the following sections:
            - Introduction
            - General Project Information
            - High Level Business Impact
            - Alternatives and Analysis
            - Preferred Solution
            - Executive Summary

            ## Key Features
            - **Conversational AI** - Handles multi-turn conversations in order to interview the user about business requirements.
            - **Business Case Generation** - Drafts business case documents based on the business requirements inputted by the user.
