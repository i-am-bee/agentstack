      processingSteps:
        - 'Generates a query: "Recent breakthroughs in quantum computing hardware"'
        - Searches the web using Tavily
        - Summarizes retrieved data
        - 'Reflects on missing insights, generating a follow-up query: "How do quantum error correction techniques improve stability?"'
        - Repeats the search-summarization cycle until the iteration limit is reached
        - Outputs a structured summary with cited sources

fullDescription: |
  This agent automates deep web research by generating queries, gathering relevant sources, summarizing key information, and iterating on knowledge gaps to refine the results. It enables structured, efficient research through a configurable workflow.

  ## How It Works
  The agent follows a structured workflow to perform iterative web research and summarization:

  - **Query Generation**: Uses an LLM to generate a precise search query based on the given research topic.
  - **Web Research**: Searches the web using different APIs (Tavily, Perplexity, DuckDuckGo) to retrieve relevant sources.
  - **Summarization**: Extracts key insights from search results and integrates them into an evolving summary.
  - **Reflection & Iteration**: Identifies knowledge gaps and generates follow-up queries for deeper research.
  - **Finalization**: Consolidates all gathered insights and sources into a structured summary.

  The agent loops through steps 2–4 until the research loop limit is reached.

  ## Input Parameters
  - **prompt** (string) – The topic to research.

  ## Key Features
  - **Iterative Research Process** – Automatically refines queries and expands knowledge.
  - **Multi-Source Information Gathering** – Supports Tavily, DuckDuckGo, and Perplexity APIs.
  - **LLM-Powered Summarization** – Generates coherent and well-structured summaries.
  - **Automated Query Refinement** – Identifies knowledge gaps and adjusts queries dynamically.

  ## Use Cases
  - **Market Research** – Automates data gathering for competitive analysis.
  - **Academic Research** – Summarizes recent findings on a specific topic.
  - **Content Creation** – Gathers background information for articles, blogs, and reports.
  - **Technical Deep Dives** – Explores emerging technologies with structured, iterative research.
