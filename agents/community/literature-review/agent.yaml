      processingSteps:
        - Initiates a round-robin task involving Google and Arxiv search agents to gather data
        - Collects and processes search results from both sources
        - The report agent synthesizes the data into a formatted literature review with appropriate references
        - Outputs the literature review, ending the task with the specified termination condition

  fullDescription: |
    The agent is designed to automate the process of conducting literature reviews by gathering, analyzing, and synthesizing information from multiple sources. It uses a combination of Google searches and Arxiv database queries to fetch relevant academic papers and data, subsequently generating a well-formatted report.

    ## How It Works
    The agent handles requests to perform literature reviews. It utilizes a set of assistant agents, including Google and Arxiv search agents, to gather information. Once the data is collected, a report agent synthesizes the information into a structured literature review, ensuring that references are correctly formatted. The process involves a round-robin communication strategy among the participating agents, with a termination condition for task completion.

    ## Input Parameters
    - **text** (string) – Contains the text query or topic for which the literature review is to be conducted.

    ## Key Features
    - **Automated Literature Review** – Conducts thorough searches across Google and Arxiv to gather relevant academic information.
    - **Structured Report Generation** – Compiles and formats the search results into a coherent literature review with proper references.
    - **Multi-Source Data Collection** – Leverages both general web searches and academic databases for comprehensive data gathering.
    - **Dynamic Agent Collaboration** – Uses a round-robin approach to coordinate between search and report agents.

    ## Use Cases
    - **Academic Research** – Supports researchers by automating the initial phase of literature review.
    - **Report Generation** – Generates structured academic reports for various topics.
    - **Resource Compilation** – Compiles a list of academic papers and articles relevant to a given topic.
