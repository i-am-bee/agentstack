  processingSteps:
    - Initializes task-specific agents to interpret the query
    - Generates a series of questions to form an objective opinion on the topic
    - Uses a crawler agent to gather and summarize information for each question
    - Aggregates and filters these summaries into a final comprehensive report

fullDescription: |
  The agent is an autonomous system designed to perform detailed research on any specified topic, leveraging both web and local resources. It generates a long, factual report complete with citations, striving to provide unbiased and accurate information. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in AI-driven research methodologies, the agent addresses common challenges like misinformation and the limits of traditional LLMs, offering robust performance through parallel processing.

  ## How It Works
  The GPT Researcher agent operates by deploying a 'planner' to generate relevant research questions and 'execution' agents to collect information. The system then aggregates these findings into a well-structured report. This approach minimizes biases by cross-referencing multiple sources and focuses on delivering comprehensive insights. It employs a custom infrastructure to ensure rapid and deterministic outcomes, making it suitable for diverse research applications.

  ## Input Parameters
  - **text** (string) – The topic or query for which the research report is to be generated.

  ## Key Features
  - **Comprehensive Research** – Generates detailed reports using information from multiple sources.
  - **Bias Reduction** – Cross-references data from various platforms to minimize misinformation and bias.
  - **High Performance** – Utilizes parallelized processes for efficient and swift report generation.
  - **Customizable** – Offers customization options to tailor research for specific domains or tasks.
