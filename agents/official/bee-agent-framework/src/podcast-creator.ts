Remember Speaker 2 is new to the topic and the conversation should always have realistic anecdotes and analogies sprinkled throughout. The questions should have real world example follow ups etc

Speaker 1: Leads the conversation and teaches the speaker 2, gives incredible anecdotes and analogies when explaining. Is a captivating teacher that gives great anecdotes

Speaker 2: Keeps the conversation on track by asking follow up questions. Gets super excited or confused when asking questions. Is a curious mindset that asks very interesting confirmation questions

Make sure the tangents speaker 2 provides are quite wild or interesting. 

Ensure there are interruptions during explanations or there are "hmm" and "umm" injected throughout from the second speaker. 

It should be a real podcast with every fine nuance documented in as much detail as possible. Welcome the listeners with a super fun overview and keep it really catchy and almost borderline click bait

DO NOT GIVE CHAPTER TITLES

    fullDescription: `The Podcast Creator converts structured content into a dynamic, natural-sounding podcast script optimized for AI-driven text-to-speech (TTS) applications. It processes input text and transforms it into a structured dialogue between two speakers: one acting as a knowledgeable host and the other as an inquisitive co-host, ensuring a conversational and engaging discussion. The generated dialogue includes interruptions, follow-up questions, and natural reactions to enhance realism.
    
## How It Works
The agent takes an input content document (e.g., an article, research paper, or structured text) and reformats it into a back-and-forth podcast-style discussion. The output maintains a logical flow, with Speaker 1 explaining concepts while Speaker 2 asks relevant questions, reacts, and occasionally introduces tangents for a more natural feel. The generated script is optimized for AI text-to-speech pipelines, ensuring clarity and proper role differentiation.

## Input Parameters
The agent requires the following input parameters:
- **prompt** (string) – The full content or topic material to be converted into a podcast dialogue.

## Output Structure
The agent returns a structured JSON list representing the podcast conversation:

- **speaker** (number) – Identifies the speaker (1 or 2).
- **text** (string) – The spoken dialogue corresponding to each speaker.\

## Key Features
- **Content-to-Podcast Conversion** – Transforms structured text into a natural two-speaker conversation.
- **Optimized for AI TTS** – Ensures readability and coherence for AI voice synthesis.
- **Contextual Interruptions & Reactions** – Simulates realistic dialogue flow, including clarifications, excitement, and pauses.
- **Speaker Role Differentiation** – Ensures Speaker 1 leads the discussion while Speaker 2 maintains curiosity and engagement.

## Use Cases

- **Podcast Automation** – Converts written content into structured dialogue for AI-generated podcasts.
- **Text-to-Speech Enhancement** – Creates AI-friendly scripts with proper pacing and interruptions.
- **Conversational Content Adaptation** – Reformats structured information into engaging discussions.

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Converting an Article into a Podcast

### Input:
\`\`\`json
${exampleInput}
\`\`\`

### CLI:
\`\`\`bash
beeai agent run podcast-creator '${exampleInput}'
\`\`\`

### Processing Steps:\

1. Extracts key concepts from the content.
2. Reformats it into a structured conversation where Speaker 1 explains ideas and Speaker 2 reacts, asks questions, and introduces clarifications.
3. Dramatises the content and outputs a structured dialogue suitable for AI voice synthesis.

### Output:

\`\`\`json
${exampleOutput}
