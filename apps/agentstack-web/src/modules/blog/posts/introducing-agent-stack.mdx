};

As our ecosystem has grown, we've heard feedback that having both "BeeAI Framework" and "BeeAI Platform" can be
confusing. To make things clearer, we're renaming BeeAI Platform to Agent Stack—a name that more accurately reflects its
purpose as open infrastructure for deploying and sharing agents without framework or vendor lock-in.

## Why the Change?

As BeeAI has evolved, we ended up with two projects with similar names:

1. **BeeAI Framework** – for building reliable, intelligent agents
2. **BeeAI Platform** – for deploying and sharing those agents

While both are essential parts of the BeeAI initiative under the Linux Foundation, the similar naming has led to some
natural confusion about which tool does what. We've heard from community members that the distinction between
"Framework" and "Platform" isn't always immediately clear, especially for newcomers.

Agent Stack makes the purpose explicit—it's your deployment stack for agents.

## What is Agent Stack?

Agent Stack is a self-hostable stack for deploying and sharing AI agents. It solves a specific problem: once you've
built an agent (using any framework or even custom code), how do you actually deploy it somewhere people can use it?

Agent Stack gives you:
- **A server** you can self-host that runs your agents
- **A web UI** where users interact with your deployed agents
- **A CLI tool** to deploy and manage your agents
- **Infrastructure services** that your agents can use:
   - Runtime-configurable LLMs - Switch between 15+ providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, watsonx.ai, Ollama) without code changes
   - Embeddings & vector search - For RAG and semantic search
   - File storage - S3-compatible uploads and downloads
   - Document text extraction - Using Docling
   - MCP connector infrastructure (bring your own connectors)
   - External tool connections - Connect to databases, APIs, Slack, Google Drive, etc. via MCP protocol with built-in OAuth
   - Secrets - Encrypted credential storage for API keys
- **An SDK** that lets your agents request these services using standardized A2A protocol extensions
- **A HELM Chart** for custom infrastructure configuration (plug in your own S3 storage, database, auth, etc.)

The SDK extensions work with any framework — if your agent is built on A2A, it can use these services regardless of
whether you built it with LangGraph, CrewAI, BeeAI Framework, or something custom.

**The workflow:**

1. Build with any framework (LangGraph, CrewAI, etc.)
2. Deploy with Agent Stack using a single CLI command
3. Share via web UI with chat interface

Agent Stack is designed to work flexibly with your infrastructure, your tools, your framework, and your LLM providers.

## Why This Matters

The agent ecosystem is evolving rapidly. Teams are experimenting with LangGraph, CrewAI, custom code—choosing different
tools for different problems. But when it comes to deployment, you face a choice: commit to one framework's hosting,
integrate with an enterprise platform, or build everything yourself.

Agent Stack explores a different path: open, self-hostable infrastructure that works across any framework.

This matters if you:

- Want to experiment with multiple frameworks without committing to one
- Need to deploy agents quickly for internal use and testing
- Have different teams using different tools
- Want infrastructure you control and can customize
- Value keeping your options open as the space evolve

Agent Stack provides self-hostable infrastructure that works with any A2A-compliant agent, giving teams flexibility
while the agent market is still figuring itself out.

## What This Means for You

### For Existing Users

This is purely a rename—the only changes are to repository URLs, CLI commands, and package names. The migration is
straightforward (see below).

- **Repository**: github.com/i-am-bee/agentstack
- **CLI**: agentstack prefix
- **SDK**: agentstack-sdk
- **Docs**: agentstack.beeai.dev
- **Starter Template**: github.com/i-am-bee/agentstack-starter

### For New Users

If you're building agents and wrestling with deployment, Agent Stack might be worth exploring!

Get up and running in one line:

```
sh -c "$(curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/i-am-bee/agentstack/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Then check out our [Quickstart Guide](https://agentstack.beeai.dev/introduction/quickstart).

## Migration Guide

### For Users

1. Uninstall the old platform:

```
beeai self uninstall
```

2. Install Agent Stack:

```
sh -c "$(curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/i-am-bee/agentstack/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

3. CLI command change:

```
agentstack [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]
```

### For Agent Builders

1. Update your SDK:

```
pip install agentstack-sdk
```

2. Update your imports:

```
from agentstack_sdk import Server  # new
```

**All agent images will need to be rebuilt to apply the appropriate change.**

## What’s Next

Agent Stack is in incubation—this means we're actively exploring what agent deployment infrastructure should look like
and learning from real-world usage. We're focused on:

- Making multi-framework deployment practical. We want to make it genuinely easy to deploy agents from different
  frameworks without rebuilding infrastructure. This means continuing to refine A2A protocol extensions and improving
  the deployment experience.
- Improving the development workflow. The CLI and web UI should get out of your way. We're gathering feedback on what
  works and what doesn't, and iterating based on real usage.
- Building ecosystem connections. As more frameworks adopt A2A, we want Agent Stack to work seamlessly with them. We're
  also exploring better ways to discover and share agents.
- Understanding real needs. Incubation means we don't have all the answers yet. We're learning what teams actually need
  from deployment infrastructure—what's essential, what's nice-to-have, and what we got wrong.

If you're building production agents, we'd love to hear what challenges you're facing with deployment. Your feedback
shapes where Agent Stack goes next.
