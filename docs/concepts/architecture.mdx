BeeAI is designed for a **local-first** experience - agents run directly on your laptop, giving you full control over your data and seamless integration with local inference engines like [ollama](https://ollama.com).

The platform is built around several core components, illustrated in the diagram below:

## Core Components

### Agents

An **agent** is a lightweight container that communicates using the [Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)](https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev). Agents may also define **tools** to extend their capabilities.

<Info>
    BeeAI comes with several built-in agents. Browse the full list in our [Agent Catalog](https://beeai.dev/agents).

### BeeAI Server

<Info>
    Dive into the [beeai-server source code](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-platform/tree/main/apps/beeai-server).
</Info>

The **BeeAI server** coordinates the platform:
- Manages the lifecycle of agents (spawning and destroying containers)
- Routes communication between agents and clients via the ACP interface
- Handles agent configs and environment variables
- Collects telemetry data and sends it to [Arize Phoenix](https://phoenix.arize.com/) via OpenTelemetry (OTEL)

The server uses an official [agent registry](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-platform/blob/main/agent-registry.yaml) on GitHub to discover available agents.

### BeeAI CLI and UI

<Info>
    Check out the
    [beeai-cli](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-platform/tree/main/apps/beeai-cli) and
    [beeai-ui](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-platform/tree/main/apps/beeai-ui) repositories.
</Info>

BeeAI offers two main interfaces:
- The CLI, for scripting and command-line control
- The UI, for interacting through a graphical interface (e.g., chat or hands-off mode)

To start interacting with an agent: `beeai run <name>`

Or open the web interface at [localhost:8333](http://localhost:8333).

## Python Client Integration

You can also integrate BeeAI into your Python applications using the [ACP SDK](https://github.com/i-am-bee/acp). This makes it easy to coordinate multiple agents programmatically within your own workflows.

## Monitoring and Observability

### Arize Phoenix Integration

BeeAI supports observability through [Arize Phoenix](https://phoenix.arize.com/), an open-source tool for tracing agent behavior.

For more details, see our [Observe Agents](/how-to/observe-agents) guide.
