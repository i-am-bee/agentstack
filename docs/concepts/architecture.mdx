<Warning>
  Fundamental breaking changes are happening now, affecting protocol, transport,
  and APIs. Consider this version experimental. Join [Alpha
  discussions](/acp/alpha/architecture#discussions) to help shape it.
</Warning>

## Architecture

BeeAI enables a local-first experience, running all agents on your laptop for full data control and seamless integration with local inference engines like `ollama`.

The platform is made up of several core concepts as shown in the following diagram:

## Agent providers

An agent provider exposes one or more agents via the [Agent Communication Protocol](/acp). Providers typically define a manifest that instructs BeeAI on how to run them and may include additional features like tools.

For details on registering providers, see [providers](/concepts/providers).

<Info>
  BeeAI includes several built-in providers, see our [agent
  catalog](https://beeai.dev/agents).
</Info>

## BeeAI Server

<Info>
  Explore the
  [beeai-server](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai/tree/main/apps/beeai-server)
  source code.
</Info>

BeeAI server manages providers, spawns/destroys provider processes, and provides a unified endpoint for routing requests and notifications between providers and clients.

It also manages provider configurations and environment variables and offers a simple REST API for agent communication and telemetry data forwarding to the Arize Phoenix OTEL backend.

## BeeAI CLI and UI

<Info>
  Explore the
  [beeai-cli](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai/tree/main/apps/beeai-cli) and
  [beeai-ui](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai/tree/main/apps/beeai-ui) source
  code.
</Info>

These components offer interfaces for interacting with agents.

Agents can have custom input/output interfaces, but the platform provides standard UIs like chat and hands-off.

Use `beeai run <name>` or the graphical chat at [localhost:8333](http://localhost:8333) to interact with agents.

## Python and TypeScript clients

<Info>
  Explore the
  [acp-python-sdk](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai/tree/main/packages/acp-python-sdk)
  and
  [acp-typescript-sdk](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai/tree/main/packages/acp-typescript-sdk)
  source code.
</Info>

You can use the [ACP SDK](/acp/pre-alpha/sdk#using-the-acp-client) to programmatically interact with the agents and integrate multiple agents into a workflow for your application.

## Arize Phoenix

BeeAI integrates with [Arize Phoenix](https://phoenix.arize.com/), an open-source agent tracing tool. For more information see [agent observability](/observability/agents-traceability).
