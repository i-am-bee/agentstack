The **Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol** is the open standard for AI agent communication, powering the BeeAI Platform. Developed under the Linux Foundation, A2A makes it possible for agents to work together seamlessly across platforms, frameworks, and ecosystems.

A2A Protocol defines how messages are structured, exchanged, and extended so agents can communicate effectively regardless of how they were built or where they're hosted. This standardization enables true agent interoperability across the ecosystem.
