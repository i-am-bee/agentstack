The **Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol** is the open standard for communication between AI agents that powers the BeeAI Platform. Developed under the **Linux Foundation** with support from IBM, Google, Microsoft, AWS, Cisco, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and SAP, A2A enables agents to interoperate seamlessly across platforms and frameworks.

A2A Protocol defines how messages are structured, exchanged, and extended so agents can communicate effectively regardless of how they were built or where they're hosted. This standardization enables true agent interoperability across the ecosystem.
