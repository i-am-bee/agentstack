<Warning>
    Fundamental breaking changes are happening now, affecting protocol, transport,
    and APIs. Consider this version experimental. Join [Alpha
    discussions](/acp/alpha/architecture#discussions) to help shape it.

# Architecture
The beeai platform was designed to provide a local-first experience with all agents running on your laptop.
This allows complete control over your data and for seamless integration with local inference engines like `ollama`.

To achieve this the platform consists of several components as shown on the diagram:

## Agent providers
Agent provider is a process that exposes one or more agents over a standardized interface - the [ACP protocol](/acp/alpha/introduction).

Typically, the provider needs to define a manifest that tells the beeai-platform how to run it. Providers can contain
other features besides agents, such as tools.

For a complete guide how to register providers to the platform, see [providers](/concepts/providers).

<Info>
    There are several providers that come with the beeai platform out of the box,
    see [agents/official](/agents/official-list) and [agents/community](/aggents/community-list).

## Beeai-platform server
The centerpiece of the architecture is the platform server which has several key responsibilities:
- manages the providers - spawns and destroys provider processes
- provides a proxy which hides all providers under single endpoint, this entails routing requests and forwarding
notifications between providers and end-user clients
- manages configuration for providers, stores and injects environment variables to providers

On top of this the server offers a simple REST API for communicating with agents and orchestrates the flow of telemetry
data from agents to Arize phoenix OTEL backend.

## Beeai CLI and Beeai UI
These two components provide a tailored user interface for communicating with agents. Agents can have a completely
custom input/output interface, however there are a couple of standardized UI interfaces that come with the
platform -- chat and hands-off. If your agent declares one of those in its metadata, you can automatically start
chatting with it using `beeai run <name>` or using the graphical chat at [localhost:8333](http://localhost:8333).
See [Agent UIs](/concepts/uis) for more information on writing each type of agent.

## Python and TypeScript clients
You can also use the [acp-sdk](/acp/pre-alpha/sdk#using-the-acp-client) to communicate with the agents from the platform
programmatically. For example, you can use multiple agents from the platform to form a workflow in your application.

## Arize Phoenix
The beeai platform is integrated with the open-source agent tracing tool [Arize Phoenix](https://phoenix.arize.com/).
