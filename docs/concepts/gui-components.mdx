description: "Customize how your agents appear and behave in the BeeAI platform interface"
---

GUI components in the BeeAI platform define how your agents appear and behave in the graphical user interface. This customization happens through two types of metadata:
1. **Standard ACP metadata** - recognized by any ACP-compliant system
2. **BeeAI platform extensions** - specific to the BeeAI platform GUI

<Note>
To fully customize your agent's appearance and behavior in the interface, you'll be using metadata defined by the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP). For details on how metadata annotations work, see the [ACP metadata documentation](https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev/core-concepts/agent-manifest#schema-metadata).
</Note>

## BeeAI Platform Extensions

BeeAI Platform extends the standard ACP metadata with platform-specific GUI customizations through the `PlatformUIAnnotation`. This annotation is placed in the `beeai_ui` field within the agent's metadata annotations.

```python
from acp_sdk import Annotations, Metadata
from acp_sdk.models.platform import PlatformUIAnnotation, PlatformUIType, AgentToolInfo

@server.agent(
    metadata=Metadata(
        annotations=Annotations(
            beeai_ui=PlatformUIAnnotation(
                ui_type=PlatformUIType.CHAT,
                user_greeting="Hello! I'm your AI assistant. How can I help you today?",
                display_name="My Custom Agent",
                tools=[
                    AgentToolInfo(name="Weather", description="Get current weather information"),
                    AgentToolInfo(name="Wikipedia", description="Search Wikipedia articles"),
                ]
            )
        )
    )
)
```

## UI Types

The platform supports two primary UI types, each optimized for different interaction patterns:

### Chat UI

The chat interface (`PlatformUIType.CHAT`) provides a conversational experience.

<Info>
    Chat UI is best suited for conversational agents, customer support bots, and multi-turn dialogues.
</Info>

### Hands-off UI

The hands-off interface (`PlatformUIType.HANDSOFF`) is designed for autonomous agents that work independently:

- **Task Execution**: Focus on agent actions rather than conversation
- **Result Display**: Clear presentation of final outcomes

<Info>
    Hands-off UI is ideal for automated workflows where there is a clear output. For example, consider a researcher agent: it receives a clearly defined input which is the research topic and then it produces a well-structured output which is the resulting research.
</Info>

## Platform-Specific Properties

### Display Name

Override the default agent name shown in the UI:

```python
PlatformUIAnnotation(
    display_name="Customer Support Assistant"
)
```

### User Greeting

Set a welcoming message displayed when users first interact with your agent:

```python
PlatformUIAnnotation(
    user_greeting="Welcome! I'm here to help you with your questions."
)
```

### Tool Information

Define the tools your agent can use, providing clear descriptions for users:

```python
PlatformUIAnnotation(
    tools=[
        AgentToolInfo(
            name="Search Engine",
            description="Search the web for current information"
        ),
        AgentToolInfo(
            name="Calculator",
            description="Perform mathematical calculations"
        ),
        AgentToolInfo(
            name="File Processor",
            description="Read and analyze uploaded files"
        )
    ]
)
```

## Standard ACP Metadata

These properties are part of the standard Agent Communication Protocol and will be recognized by any ACP-compliant system, not just BeeAI. They provide essential information about your agent that appears in the GUI.

### Tags

Custom tags help categorize and filter agents:

```python
metadata=Metadata(
    tags=["Research", "Data Analysis", "Educational"]
)
```

### Framework Badge

Shows which framework the agent is built with, with special styling for BeeAI agents:

```python
metadata=Metadata(
    framework="BeeAI"  # Displays with special BeeAI badge
)
```

### License

Shows the agent's license information:

```python
metadata=Metadata(
    license="Apache 2.0"
)
```

### Programming Language

Displays the primary programming language:

```python
metadata=Metadata(
    programming_language="Python"
)
```

### Author Information

Shows agent author details:

```python
metadata=Metadata(
    author={
        "name": "John Smith",
        "email": "jsmith@example.com",
        "url": "https://example.com"
    }
)
```

## Advanced Features

### Dynamic Content Rendering

The platform automatically renders various content types within your agent responses:

#### Markdown Support
- Headers, lists, and text formatting
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Tables and structured data
- Links and references
= Images

### Trajectory Visualization

The platform provides built-in trajectory visualization to show the step-by-step process of agent execution:

```python
from acp_sdk import MessagePart
from acp_sdk.models.models import TrajectoryMetadata

# Show trajectory steps during agent execution
yield MessagePart(metadata=TrajectoryMetadata(
    message="Processing user request with Trajectory Agent...",
    tool_name="Think"  # Optional: specify which tool is being used
))

yield MessagePart(metadata=TrajectoryMetadata(
    message="Step 1: Analyzing the problem",
    tool_name="Think"
))

yield MessagePart(metadata=TrajectoryMetadata(
    message="Step 2: Searching for relevant information",
    tool_name="Wikipedia"
))
```

<Info>
    Trajectory metadata creates a visual timeline in the UI, helping users understand the agent's reasoning process and tool usage.
</Info>

### File Upload Support

The platform automatically handles file uploads and makes them available to agents through `content_url`:

```python
import httpx

async def file_processing_agent(input: list[Message], context: Context):
    # Check for uploaded files
    for part in input[-1].parts:
        if part.content_url:
            yield MessagePart(content="üìÅ Processing uploaded file...")
            
            try:
                # Download file content
                async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
                    response = await client.get(str(part.content_url))
                    content = response.content.decode('utf-8')
                    
                    # Process the file content
                    # ... your processing logic here
                    
            except Exception as e:
                yield MessagePart(content=f"‚ùå Error processing file: {str(e)}")
```

### Citation and Sources

For agents that reference external sources, the platform provides built-in citation components:

```python
# Citations are automatically rendered when included in message metadata
MessagePart(
    content="According to recent studies...",
    metadata=CitationMetadata(
        url="https://example.com/study",
        title="Recent Research Study",
        description="Comprehensive analysis of the topic",
        start_index=0,
        end_index=25
    )
)
```
