## Delta updates of agent output

Agents send updates with `delta`, which is a subset JSON document of their output schema. `delta`s can be combined to obtain the in-progress output object, usually to display it in the UI. The merging algorithm is designed to allow for incremental-only changes in the resulting JSON.

The rules for applying a `delta` to an existing in-progress `output` JSON are, where `output + delta => new_output` denotest the combining operation:
- Different types can't combine (`1 + ["hello"] => ERROR`).
- Numbers combine by addition (`1 + 2 => 3`)
- Strings combine by joining (`"hello" + "there" => "hellothere"`)
- Objects combine by merging and combining values in common keys (`{a: 1, b: "hello"} + {b: "world", c: 2} => {a: 1, b: "helloworld", c: 2}`)
- Combining a value with `null` results in the value (`value + null => value`, `null + value => value`)
- Combining an empty array with a maybe-non-empty array results in the maybe-non-empty array (`array + [] => array`, `[] + array => array`)
    - Exception: When `output` is `[] | null | undefined` and the first element of `delta` is `null`, it is dropped: `[] + [null, "general", "Kenobi"] => ["general", "Kenobi"]` -- this is to ensure that appending to an array can be done without the knowledge of whether the array is currently empty or not
- Non-empty arrays combine by combining the last element of `output` array with the first element of `delta` array, and appending the rest of the elements.
    - `["hello", "there"] + ["general", "Kenobi"] => ["hello", "theregeneral", "Kenobi"]`
    - `["hello", "there"] + [null, "general", "Kenobi"] => ["hello", "there", "general", "Kenobi"]`
    - `[] + ["general", "Kenobi"] => ["general", "Kenobi"]`
    - `[] + [null, "general", "Kenobi"] => ["general", "Kenobi"]`
