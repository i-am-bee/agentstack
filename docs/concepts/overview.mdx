<Warning>
    Fundamental breaking changes are happening now, affecting protocol, transport,
    and APIs. Consider this version experimental. Join [Alpha
    discussions](/acp/alpha/architecture#discussions) to help shape it.

# Architecture

BeeAI enables a local-first experience, running all agents on your laptop for full data control and seamless integration with local inference engines like `ollama`.

The platform is made up of several core concepts as shown in the following diagram:

## Agent providers

An agent provider exposes one or more agents via the [Agent Communication Protocol](/acp/alpha/introduction). Providers typically define a manifest that instructs BeeAI on how to run them and may include additional features like tools.

For details on registering providers, see [providers](/concepts/providers).

<Info>
    BeeAI includes several built-in providers, see our [agent catalog](https://beeai.dev/agents).

## BeeAI server

BeeAI server manages providers, spawns/destroys provider processes, and provides a unified endpoint for routing requests and notifications between providers and clients. 

It also manages provider configurations and environment variables and offers a simple REST API for agent communication and telemetry data forwarding to the Arize Phoenix OTEL backend.

## BeeAI CLI and UI

These components offer interfaces for interacting with agents. 

Agents can have custom input/output interfaces, but the platform provides standard UIs like chat and hands-off. 

Use `beeai run <name>` or the graphical chat at [localhost:8333](http://localhost:8333) to interact with agents. 

## Python and TypeScript clients

You can use the [acp-sdk](/acp/pre-alpha/sdk#using-the-acp-client) to programmatically interact with the agents and integrate multiple agents into a workflow for your application.

## Arize Phoenix

BeeAI integrates with [Arize Phoenix](https://phoenix.arize.com/), an open-source agent tracing tool. For more information see [agent observability](/observability/agents).
