## Overview

A provider is a process that exposes one or more agents using the [Agent Communication Protocol](/acp/). This guide explains how to register different types of providers with BeeAI.

## Adding providers

You can manage providers by using the CLI:

```sh
# List providers
beeai provider list

# Show provider details
beeai provider info <id>

# Remove provider
beeai provider remove <id>

# Add a provider
beeai provider add <location>
```

### Parameters

<ParamField path="id" type="string">

Either `SHORT ID` or unique short name such as `official/beeai-framework`

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="location" type="string">

A path to the [provider manifest](#provider-manifest) detailed below. Some
examples:

- `https://github.com/org/repo` (remote location)
- `https://github.com/org/repo@version-tag#path=/sub/directory/custom-provider.yaml` (GitHub location with a specific version-tag and path within the github repository)
- `file:///absolute/path/to/beeai-provider.yaml` (local filesystem)

</ParamField>

## Provider manifest

The provider manifest (`beeai-provider.yaml`) defines how a provider connects to BeeAI. The platform uses it to start a new provider process.

Below is the list of supported providers.

### Python provider

<Info>This provider uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).</Info>

```yaml beeai-provider.yaml [expandable]
manifestVersion: 1
driver: python
pythonVersion: "3.11" # optional, will be installed if not found on machine

# Package location that can be used in a `uvx --from` clause
# see  (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools)
# For example a package published on PyPI:
# package: "my-pypi-package@0.0.1"
#
# Or a package from GitHub:
package:
  "git+https://github.com/org/repo@agents-v0.0.1"

  # Executable command to run provider (must be part of the package)
command: ["gpt-researcher-agent"]

# These options are the recommended configuration
# stdio serverType is supported, but highly experimental:
serverType: http
mcpTransport: sse
mcpEndpoint: /sse

env: # Environment variables consumed by this provider
  - name: "LLM_API_KEY"
    description: "Secret key for accessing model"
    required: True
```

### Node.js provider

<Info>This provider uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).</Info>

```yaml beeai-provider.yaml [expandable]
manifestVersion: 1
driver: nodejs

# Package location that can be used in a `npx` clause or a GitHub URL
# For example a package published on NPM:
# package: "my-npm-opackage@0.0.1"
#
# Or a package from GitHub
package: "git+https://github.com/org/repo@agents-v0.0.1"

# Executable command to run provider (must be part of the package)
command: ["server"]

# These options are the recommended configuration
# stdio serverType is supported, but highly experimental:
serverType: http
mcpTransport: sse
mcpEndpoint: /sse

env: [] # Environment variables (see above in python provider above)
```

### Container provider

<Warning>
  This provider requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/),
  [Podman](https://podman.io/) or similar runtime installed, we recommend
  [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/).
</Warning>

```yaml beeai-provider.yaml [expandable]
manifestVersion: 1
driver: container

# Public docker image (identifier that can be used in docker run)
image: docker.io/something/here:1.0.0

# These options are the recommended configuration
# stdio serverType is supported, but highly experimental:
serverType: http
mcpTransport: sse
mcpEndpoint: /sse

env: [] # Environment variables (see above in python provider above)
```

### Unmanaged provider

An unmanaged provider is a special case where the BeeAI platform does not manage the providerâ€™s lifecycle. Instead, you register an already running provider.

This is useful for:

- Local development
- Running agents on a separate infrastructure

For example, if you're running an agent server locally (e.g., by cloning the provider template and executing `uv run beeai-agents`), you can register it using the following manifest:

```yaml beeai-provider.yaml [expandable]
manifestVersion: 1
driver: unmanaged
serverType: http
mcpTransport: sse
mcpEndpoint: /sse
# env: []
# Not valid for unmanaged provider as the provider process is already
# running, instead inject env directly when starting the provider server,
# for example: env MY_VARIABLE=MY_VALUE uv run beeai-agents
```
