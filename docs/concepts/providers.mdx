# Adding providers
Agent provider is a process that exposes one or more agents over a standardized interface -
the [ACP protocol](/acp/alpha/introduction). This guide will show how to register different types of providers to the
platform.

You can add providers by using the CLI, few basic commands:
- `beeai provider list` - list providers
- `beeai provider info <ID>` - show provider info (ID can be either `SHORT ID` from `beeai provider list`
or unique short name such as `official/beeai-framework`)
- `beeai provider remove <ID>` - remove provider
- `beeai provider add <location>`, where `location` is a filesystem path to the [provider manifest](#provider-manifest),
for example:
  ```sh
  # Github repository
  beeai provider add 'https://github.com/org/repo'
  # Specific version-tag and path inside github repository
  beeai provider add 'https://github.com/org/repo@version-tag#path=/sub/directory/custom-provider.yaml'

  # Local providers
  # if you have `beeai-provider.yaml` in the current directory:
  beeai provider add 'file://.'
  # Absolute path
  beeai provider add 'file:///absolute/path/to/beeai-provider.yaml'
    ```


## Provider manifest
The manifest file (typically named `beeai-provider.yaml`) determines how to instantiate the provider connection.
The beeai-platform server typically uses it to spawn a new provider process. The supported kinds of providers are:

### Python provider
Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed globally (requirement is satisfied when installing beeai through brew)

```yaml
manifestVersion: 1
driver: python
pythonVersion: "3.11" # optional, will be installed if not found on machine

# Package location that can be used in a `uvx --from` clause
# see  (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools)
# For example a package published on PyPI:
# package: "my-pypi-package@0.0.1"
#
# Or a package from GitHub:
package: "git+https://github.com/org/repo@agents-v0.0.1"

 # Executable command to run provider (must be part of the package)
command: [ "gpt-researcher-agent" ]

# These options are the recommended configuration
# stdio serverType is supported, but highly experimental:
serverType: http
mcpTransport: sse
mcpEndpoint: /sse

env: # Environment variables consumed by this provider
  - name: "LLM_API_KEY"
    description: "Secret key for accessing model"
    required: True
```

### NodeJs provider
Requires [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) installed globally (requirement is satisfied when installing beeai through brew)

```yaml
manifestVersion: 1
driver: nodejs

# Package location that can be used in a `npx` clause or a GitHub URL
# For example a package published on NPM:
# package: "my-npm-opackage@0.0.1"
#
# Or a package from GitHub
package: "git+https://github.com/org/repo@agents-v0.0.1"

# Executable command to run provider (must be part of the package)
command: [ "server" ]

# These options are the recommended configuration
# stdio serverType is supported, but highly experimental:
serverType: http
mcpTransport: sse
mcpEndpoint: /sse

env: [] # Environment variables (see above in python provider above)
```

### Container provider
Requires [docker](https://www.docker.com/), [podman](https://podman.io/) or similar runtime installed, we recommend
[Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/).

```yaml

manifestVersion: 1
driver: container

# Public docker image (identifier that can be used in docker run)
image: docker.io/something/here:1.0.0

# These options are the recommended configuration
# stdio serverType is supported, but highly experimental:
serverType: http
mcpTransport: sse
mcpEndpoint: /sse

env: [] # Environment variables (see above in python provider above)
```

### Unmanaged provider
This is a special kind of provider where the platform does not manage the lifecycle of the provider process. Instead,
you may have a provider server running on a certain address:port already, and you simply want to connect it to the
platform. This is especially useful when developing agents locally or for quick implementation.

For example, if you have an agent server running locally when you clone the provider template
and run `uv run beeai-agents`, you can register it using the following manifest:


```yaml
manifestVersion: 1
driver: unmanaged
serverType: http
mcpTransport: sse
mcpEndpoint: /sse

# env: []
# Not valid for unmanaged provider as the provider process is already
# running, instead inject env directly when starting the provider server,
# for example: env MY_VARIABLE=MY_VALUE uv run beeai-agents
```
