## Overview

A provider is a process that exposes one or more agents using the [Agent Communication Protocol](/acp/). This guide explains how to register different types of providers with BeeAI.

## Adding providers

You can manage providers by using the CLI:

```sh
# List providers
beeai provider list

# Show provider details
beeai provider info <id>

# Remove provider
beeai provider remove <id>

# Add a provider
beeai provider add <location>
```

### Parameters

<ParamField path="id" type="string">

Either `SHORT ID` or unique short name such as `official/beeai-framework`

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="location" type="string">

A path to the [provider manifest](#provider-manifest) detailed below. Some
examples:

- `https://github.com/org/repo` (remote location)
- `https://github.com/org/repo@version-tag#path=/sub/directory/custom-provider.yaml` (GitHub location with a specific version-tag and path within the github repository)
- `file:///absolute/path/to/beeai-provider.yaml` (local filesystem)

</ParamField>

## Provider manifest

The manifest file (typically named `beeai-provider.yaml`) determines how to instantiate the provider connection.
The beeai-platform server typically uses it to spawn a new provider process. The supported kinds of providers are:

### Python provider

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed globally (requirement is satisfied when installing beeai through brew)

```yaml
manifestVersion: 1
driver: python
pythonVersion: "3.11" # optional, will be installed if not found on machine

# Package location that can be used in a `uvx --from` clause
# see  (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools)
# For example a package published on PyPI:
# package: "my-pypi-package@0.0.1"
#
# Or a package from GitHub:
package:
  "git+https://github.com/org/repo@agents-v0.0.1"

  # Executable command to run provider (must be part of the package)
command: ["gpt-researcher-agent"]

# These options are the recommended configuration
# stdio serverType is supported, but highly experimental:
serverType: http
mcpTransport: sse
mcpEndpoint: /sse

env: # Environment variables consumed by this provider
  - name: "LLM_API_KEY"
    description: "Secret key for accessing model"
    required: True
```

### NodeJs provider

Requires [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) installed globally (requirement is satisfied when installing beeai through brew)

```yaml
manifestVersion: 1
driver: nodejs

# Package location that can be used in a `npx` clause or a GitHub URL
# For example a package published on NPM:
# package: "my-npm-opackage@0.0.1"
#
# Or a package from GitHub
package: "git+https://github.com/org/repo@agents-v0.0.1"

# Executable command to run provider (must be part of the package)
command: ["server"]

# These options are the recommended configuration
# stdio serverType is supported, but highly experimental:
serverType: http
mcpTransport: sse
mcpEndpoint: /sse

env: [] # Environment variables (see above in python provider above)
```

### Container provider

Requires [docker](https://www.docker.com/), [podman](https://podman.io/) or similar runtime installed, we recommend
[Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/).

```yaml
manifestVersion: 1
driver: container

# Public docker image (identifier that can be used in docker run)
image: docker.io/something/here:1.0.0

# These options are the recommended configuration
# stdio serverType is supported, but highly experimental:
serverType: http
mcpTransport: sse
mcpEndpoint: /sse

env: [] # Environment variables (see above in python provider above)
```

### Unmanaged provider

This is a special kind of provider where the platform does not manage the lifecycle of the provider process. Instead,
you may have a provider server running on a certain address:port already, and you simply want to connect it to the
platform. This is especially useful when developing agents locally or for quick implementation.

For example, if you have an agent server running locally when you clone the provider template
and run `uv run beeai-agents`, you can register it using the following manifest:

```yaml
manifestVersion: 1
driver: unmanaged
serverType: http
mcpTransport: sse
mcpEndpoint: /sse
# env: []
# Not valid for unmanaged provider as the provider process is already
# running, instead inject env directly when starting the provider server,
# for example: env MY_VARIABLE=MY_VALUE uv run beeai-agents
```
