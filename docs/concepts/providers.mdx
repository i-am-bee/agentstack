<Warning>
    Fundamental breaking changes are happening now, affecting protocol, transport,
    and APIs. Consider this version experimental. Join [Alpha
    discussions](/acp/alpha/architecture#discussions) to help shape it.
</Warning>

## Overview 

A **provider** is a service that exposes one or more agents using a standardized interface - the [Agent Communication Protocol](https://chatgpt.com/acp/alpha/introduction). This guide explains how to register different types of providers with BeeAI.

## Adding providers

You can add, list, and remove providers by running:

### **List** providers
```sh
beeai provider list
```

### **Show** provider details
```sh
beeai provider info <ID>
```

<Note>
  ID can be either `SHORT ID` or unique short name such as `official/beeai-framework`.
</Note>

### **Remove** a provider
```sh
beeai provider remove <ID>
```

### **Add** a provider
```sh
beeai provider add <location>
```

<Note>
`location` is a filesystem path to the provider manifest, detailed below.
</Note>

## Examples

### Add a provider from GitHub

```sh
beeai provider add 'https://github.com/org/repo'
```

### Add a specific version and path from GitHub
  
```sh
beeai provider add 'https://github.com/org/repo@version-tag#path=/sub/directory/custom-provider.yaml'
```

### Add a local provider
If `beeai-provider.yaml` is in the current directory:
```sh
beeai provider add 'file://.'
```
Using an absolute path
```sh
beeai provider add 'file:///absolute/path/to/beeai-provider.yaml'
```

## Provider manifest

The **provider manifest** (`beeai-provider.yaml`) defines how a provider connects to BeeAI. The platform uses it to start a new provider process.

### Supported providers types

1. **Python** provider (runs with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)) 

<Note>
  This requirement is satisfied when installing BeeAI through brew.
</Note>

<Expandable title="example">
```yaml
manifestVersion: 1
driver: python
pythonVersion: "3.11" # optional, will be installed if not found on machine

# Package location that can be used in a `uvx --from` clause
# see  (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools)
# For example a package published on PyPI:
# package: "my-pypi-package@0.0.1"
#
# Or a package from GitHub:
package: "git+https://github.com/org/repo@agents-v0.0.1"

 # Executable command to run provider (must be part of the package)
command: [ "gpt-researcher-agent" ]

# These options are the recommended configuration
# stdio serverType is supported, but highly experimental:
serverType: http
mcpTransport: sse
mcpEndpoint: /sse

env: # Environment variables consumed by this provider
  - name: "LLM_API_KEY"
    description: "Secret key for accessing model"
    required: True
```
</Expandable>

2. **NodeJs** provider (runs with [nodejs](https://nodejs.org)) 

<Note>
  This requirement is satisfied when installing BeeAI through brew.
</Note>

<Expandable title="example">
```yaml
manifestVersion: 1
driver: nodejs

# Package location that can be used in a `npx` clause or a GitHub URL
# For example a package published on NPM:
# package: "my-npm-opackage@0.0.1"
#
# Or a package from GitHub
package: "git+https://github.com/org/repo@agents-v0.0.1"

# Executable command to run provider (must be part of the package)
command: [ "server" ]

# These options are the recommended configuration
# stdio serverType is supported, but highly experimental:
serverType: http
mcpTransport: sse
mcpEndpoint: /sse

env: [] # Environment variables (see above in python provider above)
```
</Expandable>

3. **Container** provider (runs with [docker](https://www.docker.com/), [podman](https://podman.io/) or a similar runtime)

<Tip>
  We recommend [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/).
</Tip>

<Expandable title="example">
```yaml
manifestVersion: 1
driver: container

# Public docker image (identifier that can be used in docker run)
image: docker.io/something/here:1.0.0

# These options are the recommended configuration
# stdio serverType is supported, but highly experimental:
serverType: http
mcpTransport: sse
mcpEndpoint: /sse

env: [] # Environment variables (see above in python provider above)
```
</Expandable>

4. **Unmanaged** provider (external, already running process)

An unmanaged provider is a special case where the BeeAI platform does not manage the providerâ€™s lifecycle. Instead, you register an already running provider service.

This is useful for:
- Local development
- Running agents on a separate infrastructure

<Expandable title="example">
You may have an agent server running locally when you clone the provider template and run `uv run beeai-agents`. This can be registered using the following manifest:

```yaml
manifestVersion: 1
driver: unmanaged
serverType: http
mcpTransport: sse
mcpEndpoint: /sse

# env: []
# Not valid for unmanaged provider as the provider process is already
# running, instead inject env directly when starting the provider server,
# for example: env MY_VARIABLE=MY_VALUE uv run beeai-agents
```
