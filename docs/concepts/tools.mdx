Tools in the beeai platform are implemented in line with the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).
Adding a tool to the provider is straightforward:

```python
import asyncio
from acp.server.highlevel import Server, Context
from beeai_sdk.providers.agent import run_agent_provider

def main():
    server = Server("beeai-agents")

    @server.tool()
    async def add(a: int, b: int, ctx: Context) -> int:
        """Add two numbers"""
        return a + b

    asyncio.run(run_agent_provider(server))
```

After registering the provider (see [Providers](/cocepts/providers)) to the platform, the tool will be available using
the CLI. We can see it in `beeai tool list` and we can invoke it directly using:
```sh
> beeai tool run add '{"a": 1, "b": 2}'
```

The tools can be used programmatically and by agents through the [acp-sdk](/acp/pre-alpha/sdk) package or even
through the original [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). This means that you can leverage adapters in frameworks
such as:
- [LangChain MCP Adapters](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-mcp-adapters)
- [BeeAI framework MCP Tool](https://i-am-bee.github.io/beeai-framework/#/python/tools?id=mcp-tool)

to enrich agents with tools available in the beeai platform.
