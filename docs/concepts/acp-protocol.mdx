description: "Learn how ACP powers agent interoperability in BeeAI"

BeeAI Platform is built on the [Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)](https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev), an open standard designed to enable smooth communication between AI agents, regardless of what framework they're built on.

## What is ACP?

ACP defines a minimal RESTful API for agent communication, supporting:
- Synchronous and asynchronous messaging with streaming capabilities
- Multimodal content (text, images, files, artifacts)
- Framework-agnostic design that works with any agent implementation
- Lightweight requirements for easy adoption

## How BeeAI Uses ACP

As the official implementation of ACP, BeeAI leverages the protocol to:

- Discover agents from any ACP-compliant framework
- Run agents locally with your preferred LLM provider
- Orchestrate workflows by chaining agents together
- Maintain consistency across different agent types and sources
