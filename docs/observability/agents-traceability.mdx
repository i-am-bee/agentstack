Agents within the Agent Stack can be instrumented using the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) standard.

Traces from instrumented agents can be collected and sent to the [Arize Phoenix](https://phoenix.arize.com/) observability backend for storage and visualization.

To visualize agent traces:

<Steps>
   <Step title="Enable Arize Phoenix">

Start the platform with Arize Phoenix enabled:

```sh
agentstack platform start --set phoenix.enabled=true
```

   </Step>
   <Step title="Run an instrumented agent">

Execute the following command to run an example chat agent:

```sh
agentstack run chat "Hello"
```

   </Step>
   <Step title="View traces in Phoenix GUI">
      Open http://localhost:6006 in your browser and navigate to the **default** project to explore the collected traces.
   </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  For an enhanced user experience, consider instrumenting agents according to
  the [OpenInference](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference/) standard.
