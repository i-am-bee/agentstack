Agents within the platform may be instrumented using [Opentelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) standard.

Traces from such agents are collected and sent to Arize Phoenix observability backend for storage and visualization.

To see the traces:

1. Make sure [Arize Phoenix](https://phoenix.arize.com/) is up and running:

```sh
brew install i-am-bee/beeai/arize-phoenix && brew services start arize-phoenix
```

2. Run any instrumented agent, e.g. **chat** agent:

```sh
beeai agent run chat Howdy!
```

3. Go to Arize Phoenix GUI and find the trace:

   Open http://localhost:6006 in your browser and navigate to **default** project

User experience will be futher improved if agent instrumentation follows [Openinference](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference/) standard.
