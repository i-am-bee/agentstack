## Overview

To enable full observability for your BeeAI agents, you can instrument them using [OpenInference](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference), follow the steps below for both [**Python**](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#libraries) and [**JavaScript**](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#libraries-1) frameworks. 
These instructions will guide you through the installation and setup of OpenInference instrumentation, enabling you to capture and export telemetry data effectively.

> ⚠️ Note: This guide only covers frameworks that are officially supported by the OpenInference ecosystem. If a framework is not part of OpenInference, we do not provide instrumentation guidance for it.

> Be sure you have already run the Phoenix server. See the [Agent Traceability](/observability/agents-traceability) site for more details.

## Python Instrumentation example
1. **Install Required Packages**: Begin by installing the necessary packages:
```shell
pip install beeai-framework openinference-instrumentation-beeai
```
2. **Instrument BeeAI Framework**: Apply the OpenInference instrumentation to the BeeAI framework:
```
from openinference.instrumentation.beeai import BeeAIInstrumentor

# Instrument the BeeAI framework
BeeAIInstrumentor().instrument()
```
3. **Use BeeAI as Usual**: Proceed with your standard BeeAI agent implementations. The instrumentation will automatically capture and export relevant telemetry data.

> See [OpenInference Instrumentation for BeeAI](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference/tree/main/python/instrumentation/openinference-instrumentation-beeai) on how to run the instrumentation outside of the **BeeAI**.

## JavaScript Instrumentation example
1. **Install Required Packages**: Begin by installing the necessary packages:
```shell
npm install --save @arizeai/openinference-instrumentation-beeai beeai-framework
```
2. **Instrument BeeAI Framework**: Apply the OpenInference instrumentation to the BeeAI framework:
```
import { BeeAIInstrumentation } from "@arizeai/openinference-instrumentation-beeai";
import * as beeaiFramework from "beeai-framework";

const beeAIInstrumentation = new BeeAIInstrumentation();
beeAIInstrumentation.manuallyInstrument(beeaiFramework);
```
3. **Use BeeAI as Usual**: Proceed with your standard BeeAI agent implementations. The instrumentation will automatically capture and export relevant telemetry data.
