The telemetry sharing functionality in the BeeAI platform collects metrics and operational data to provide insights into how the platform operates in real-world environments, it is **enabled** by default. This feature helps us:

- Identify performance bottlenecks.
- Improve platform stability and reliability.

## Data Collected

We value your privacy and ensure that **no sensitive data** is collected through telemetry sharing. The following types of information are gathered:

- Platform version and runtime environment details.
- Anonymized usage statistics for built-in features.
