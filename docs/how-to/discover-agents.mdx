BeeAI provides a curated catalog of ready-to-use AI agents to help you get started and understand the platform's capabilities. 

## Agent Catalog

The easiest way to browse available agents is through the [Agent Catalog](https://beeai.dev/agents). This visual interface lets you explore agents by their capabilities, types, and usage examples.

To explore from the command line, use:

```bash
beeai list
```

This will return a list of agents with:
- **Name** - The agent identifier
- **State** - Current status (ready, running, starting, missing, error)
- **Description** - Brief description of what the agent does
- **Location** - Source registry or image location

## Agent Details

To learn more about a specific agent before using it, run:

```bash
beeai info <agent-name>
```

This will show:
- Full description and capabilities
- Usage examples and CLI commands
- Input parameters and output structure
- Integrated tools and features
- Configuration options and environment variables
- Provider and container information
- Current status and error logs

## Agent Types

Agents come in different types depending on how they interact with users. The agent type also determines how it's presented in the GUI.

### Chat Agents

Chat agents support live, conversational interactions. They're best for tasks requiring a back-and-forth dialogue. These agents use a chat-based interface in the GUI.

### Hands-off Agents  

Hands-off agents are designed to run autonomously after receiving a single instruction. They don't need further input once started. In the GUI, these agents offer a streamlined experience focused on execution and results.
