BeeAI provides a curated catalog of ready-to-use AI agents to help you get started and understand the platform's capabilities. 

The easiest way to browse available agents is through the [Agent Catalog](https://beeai.dev/agents). This visual interface lets you explore agents by their capabilities, types, and usage examples.

## List Agents

To explore agents from the command line, use:

```bash
beeai list
```

This command returns a table of installed and available agents with the following columns:

| **Field**       | **Description**                                                                 |
|:-----------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **NAME**         | The agent identifier.                                                            |
| **STATUS**       | Current installation state of the agent.                        |
| **DESCRIPTION**  | A brief summary of what the agent does.                                         |
| **UI**           | The type of user interface it supports, such as `chat`, `hands-off`, or `<none>`. |
| **LOCATION**     | The source registry path for the agent image.                                   |
| **MISSING ENV**  | Lists any missing environment variables (if applicable).                        |
| **LAST ERROR**   | Displays the last recorded error message (if applicable).                       |

## Install Agents

If an agent's **STATUS** is `not_installed`, that means it's available but not yet downloaded to your environment. Youâ€™ll need to install it before you can run it.

To install an agent:

```bash
beeai add <agent_name>
```

## Agent Details

To learn more about a specific agent before using it, run:

```bash
beeai info <agent-name>
```

This will show:
- Full description and capabilities
- Usage examples and CLI commands
- Input parameters and output structure
- Integrated tools and features
- Configuration options and environment variables
- Provider and container information
- Current status and error logs

## Agent Types

Agents come in different types depending on how they interact with users. The agent type also determines how it's presented in the GUI.

### Chat Agents

Chat agents support live, conversational interactions. They're best for tasks requiring a back-and-forth dialogue. These agents use a chat-based interface in the GUI.

### Hands-off Agents  

Hands-off agents are designed to run autonomously after receiving a single instruction. They don't need further input once started. In the GUI, these agents offer a streamlined experience focused on execution and results.
