description: "Learn how to register MCP servers into the platform and create curated toolkits for agents to use"
---

## Prerequisites

- [BeeAI Platform](/introduction/quickstart) installed
- Arbitrary [MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) with tools served over [Streamable HTTP transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#streamable-http)

<Tip>
  You may use
  [server-everything](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything)
  to complete the tutorial.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  If your server only supports `stdio` transport, use
  [supergateway](https://github.com/supercorp-ai/supergateway) to wrap it.
</Tip>

## Register the MCP server

Start by registering the MCP server into the Platform:

```bash
beeai mcp add <server-name> <server-url>
```

## List available tools

List available MCP tools:

<Note>
  If you have multiple MCP servers registered, tools across all the servers will
  be listed.
</Note>

```bash
beeai mcp tools
```

## Create a toolkit

Create a toolkit:

```bash
beeai mcp toolkit <tool-1> <tool-2> ...
```

Toolkit is just another MCP server containing the selected tools. It is served over Streamable HTTP.

<Note>
  Toolkits have an expiration. They are temporary resources meant to be used by
  an agent for a single task.
</Note>

## Use the toolkit with your agent

Grab the URL of the toolkit and give it to an agent. The agent can now use this URL with the MCP client to connect an use the toolkit.

<Note>
  We're working on a mechanism for agents to receive arbitrary MCP server as a
  dependency injection over the agent protocol. Currently, the URL delivery must
  be done out of bound.
</Note>
