Once you've [built an agent](/how-to/build-agents), there are several ways to share it with others. Choose the method that best fits your needs - whether you want to share publicly with the entire community or privately with just a few trusted collaborators.

## Public Sharing

### GitHub Repository

The most common way to share agents publicly is through GitHub repositories. This provides transparency, version control, and easy distribution.

```bash
# Users can add your agent directly from GitHub
beeai add "https://github.com/your-username/your-agent-repo"

# With specific versions or branches
beeai add "https://github.com/your-username/your-agent-repo@v1.0.0"
beeai add "https://github.com/your-username/your-agent-repo@develop"

# From specific subdirectories
beeai add "https://github.com/your-username/your-agent-repo#path=/agents/my-agent"
```

**Requirements for GitHub sharing:**
- Repository must be publicly accessible
- Must contain a `Dockerfile` in the root or specified path
- Agent must follow ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) standards
- Include proper agent metadata and documentation

### Public Container Registry

Share pre-built Docker images through public container registries:

```bash
# GitHub Container Registry (recommended for open source)
beeai add ghcr.io/your-username/your-agent:latest

# Docker Hub
beeai add your-username/your-agent:v1.0
```

<Tip>
The [agent template](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-platform-agent-starter) includes GitHub Actions that automatically build and publish to GitHub Container Registry on every push to main.
</Tip>

## Private Sharing

### Private Container Registry

For sharing with select people while maintaining control over access:

```bash
# GitHub Container Registry (private)
beeai add ghcr.io/your-username/private-agent:latest

# Private Docker registry
beeai add registry.your-company.com/team/private-agent:latest
```

**Steps to set up private sharing:**

<Steps>
<Step title="Build your agent">
```bash
beeai build . --tag my-private-agent:latest
```
</Step>

<Step title="Tag for private registry">
```bash
docker tag my-private-agent:latest ghcr.io/your-username/private-agent:latest
```
</Step>

<Step title="Push to private registry">
```bash
docker push ghcr.io/your-username/private-agent:latest
```
</Step>

<Step title="Share access">
Provide trusted users with:
- The image URL: `ghcr.io/your-username/private-agent:latest`
- Access credentials to your private registry
</Step>
</Steps>

### Direct Image Sharing

For quick sharing with a small group without setting up a registry:

```bash
# Build the agent locally
beeai build . --tag my-private-agent:latest

# Export to a file
docker save my-private-agent:latest > my-agent.tar

# Share the .tar file with trusted users
```

Users can then load and use the shared image:

```bash
# Load the shared image
docker load < my-agent.tar

# Add to BeeAI
beeai add my-private-agent:latest
```

<Warning>
Direct file sharing works well for small groups but doesn't scale for larger teams or provide version management.
</Warning>
