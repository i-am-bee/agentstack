Once you've [built an agent](/how-to/build-agents), there are several ways to share it with others.

<Note>
Projects must follow the structure defined by the [beeai-platform-agent-starter](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-platform-agent-starter) template for proper sharing functionality.
</Note>

## Share via GitHub

The easiest way to share your agent is by pushing it to a public GitHub repository.

Share your repository URL:
```bash
# Share the main branch
https://github.com/your-username/your-agent-repo

# Share a specific version
https://github.com/your-username/your-agent-repo#v1.0.0
```

Others can install your agent using the BeeAI CLI:

```bash
# Add from main branch (latest)
beeai add "https://github.com/your-username/your-agent-repo"

# Add specific version
beeai add "https://github.com/your-username/your-agent-repo#v1.0.0"

# Add with specific path (for monorepos)
beeai add "https://github.com/your-username/monorepo#main:agents/my-agent"
```

<Tip>
**Versioning Tip**: Use Git tags like `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, etc., to manage releases before sharing them. This will help
    you prevent unwanted updates compared to always using latest main. You can upgrade agents
    by deleting them with `beeai remove` and adding again with the new version.
</Tip>

## Share via Container Registry

You can also share pre-built Docker images for even faster installation:

```bash
# GitHub Container Registry (public)
beeai add ghcr.io/your-username/your-agent:latest
beeai add ghcr.io/your-username/your-agent:v1.0.0

# Docker Hub
beeai add your-username/your-agent:latest

# Private registries
beeai add registry.yourcompany.com/team/agent:v2.1.0
```

<Note>
**Why Containers?** Pre-built images install instantlyâ€”they donâ€™t need to be built on the userâ€™s machine.
</Note> 

<Note>
**CI/CD Ready**: The starter template includes a full GitHub Actions workflow to automate builds. See the [`build-agent.yaml`](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-platform-agent-starter/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-agent.yaml) file for details.
