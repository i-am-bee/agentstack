BeeAI provides multiple ways to add agents to your platform. This guide explains each method and when to use them.

## Prerequisite

### Docker Setup

Most import methods require Docker to be running:
- **macOS:** Install Docker Desktop or Rancher Desktop
- **Linux:** Install Docker Engine and QEMU
- **Windows:** Install Docker Desktop

## Quick Start

Just want to get started? Try importing a ready-made agent:

```bash
beeai add https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-platform-agent-starter.git
```

## How It Works

BeeAI discovers and runs agents automatically using the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP). When you add an agent:
1. **Auto-discovery:** Agents running locally are automatically detected
2. **Containerization:** Remote agents are built into Docker containers
3. **Registration:** All agents appear in both CLI and web interface

## Adding Agents

### Local Development (Recommended for Development)

When building ACP-compliant agents locally, BeeAI automatically discovers them:

```bash
# Start your agent server
uv run my_agent.py

# Your agent automatically appears in BeeAI
beeai list  # Shows your local agent
```

Benefits:
- Instant feedback during development
- No build process needed
- Changes reflected immediately

Requirements:
- Agent must implement ACP protocol
- Must be running on accessible port

### From GitHub Repositories

Import agents directly from public GitHub repositories:

```bash
# Basic import
beeai add "https://github.com/username/my-agent.git"

# With specific version
beeai add "https://github.com/username/my-agent.git#v1.0.0"

# With specific branch
beeai add "https://github.com/username/my-agent.git#develop"

# From subdirectory
beeai add "https://github.com/username/my-agent.git#:agents/my-agent"

# Combined version and path
beeai add "https://github.com/username/multi-agent-repo.git#v2.1.0:agents/specialized-agent"
```

Requirements:
- Repository must contain a Dockerfile
- Agent must follow ACP protocol
- Repository must be publicly accessible
- Docker must be running locally

### From Local Filesystem

Build and add agents from your local machine:

```bash
# Add from current directory
beeai add .

# Add from specific directory
beeai add /path/to/my-agent
```

**For advanced users:** If you need more control over the build process:

```bash
# Build only (for testing)
beeai build /path/to/my-agent --no-import

# Build with custom tag
beeai build . --tag my-custom-agent:dev

# Add the built image separately
beeai add beeai.local/my-agent-hash:latest
```

Requirements:
- Directory must contain a Dockerfile
- Docker must be running locally

### From Docker Images

Add pre-built Docker images:

```bash
# From GitHub Container Registry
beeai add ghcr.io/i-am-bee/beeai-platform/community/aider:latest

# From Docker Hub
beeai add myuser/my-agent:v1.0

# From private registry
beeai add registry.example.com/team/custom-agent:latest
```

## Managing Agents

### Check Agent Status

```bash
beeai list
```

Shows all agents with their status, location, and any configuration issues.

### Remove Agents

```bash
beeai remove <agent-name>

# Alternative commands
beeai uninstall <agent-name>
beeai delete <agent-name>
beeai rm <agent-name>
```

### Get Agent Details

```bash
beeai info <agent-name>
```

Shows documentation, capabilities, and configuration options.
