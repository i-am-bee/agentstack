BeeAI provides multiple ways to work with agents in your local environment. This guide explains how to add and manage agents effectively.

## Adding Agents

### Auto-Discovery for Local Development

When developing ACP-compliant agents locally, BeeAI automatically discovers them without manual setup:

```bash
# Example: Run an ACP agent on port 8000 
uv run my_agent.py

# The agent automatically appears in BeeAI
beeai list  # Your agent will be visible here
```

<Info>
  Auto-discovered agents appear in both the CLI and web UI automatically. No manual import needed!
</Info>

### From GitHub Repositories

Import agents directly from GitHub repositories that contain proper Dockerfiles. Try this ready-to-go starter project:

```bash
beeai add "https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-platform-agent-starter"
```

More import options:

```bash
# Specify a version or branch
beeai add "https://github.com/i-am-bee/custom-agent@v1.0.0"
beeai add "https://github.com/i-am-bee/custom-agent@develop"

# Import from specific subdirectory
beeai add "https://github.com/i-am-bee/custom-agent#path=/agents/my-agent"

# Combined version and path
beeai add "https://github.com/i-am-bee/multi-agent-repo@v2.1.0#path=/agents/specialized-agent"
```

<Note>
  **Requirements for GitHub import:**
  - Repository must contain a `Dockerfile` in the root or specified path
  - Agent must follow ACP protocol standards
  - Repository must be publicly accessible
</Note>

### From Docker Images

Add agents from pre-built Docker images:

```bash
# From GitHub Container Registry
beeai add ghcr.io/i-am-bee/beeai-platform/community/aider:latest

# From Docker Hub
beeai add myuser/my-agent:v1.0

# From private registry
beeai add registry.example.com/team/custom-agent:latest
```

### Build and Add Local Agents

For local development and testing:

```bash
# Build an agent from current directory
beeai build .

# Build from specific directory
beeai build /path/to/my-agent

# Build with custom tag
beeai build . --tag my-custom-agent:dev

# Build without importing (for testing)
beeai build . --no-import
```

The built agent will automatically be available in your agent list.

## Removing Agents

When you no longer need an agent:

```bash
# Remove by agent name
beeai remove <agent-name>

# Alternative commands (aliases)
beeai uninstall <agent-name>
beeai delete <agent-name>
beeai rm <agent-name>
```

<Warning>
  **Important considerations when removing agents:**
  - This deletes the agent's Docker image from your system
  - For locally built agents, you'll need to rebuild them to use again
</Warning>

## Checking Agent Status

You can check the status of your agents at any time:

```bash
beeai list
```
