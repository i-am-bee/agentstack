The BeeAI web interface is a minimalist GUI built for simplicity and ease of use. Itâ€™s designed with end users in mind - especially teams and business users who want to run AI agents without touching the command line or diving into technical details.

## Getting Started

Launch the web interface:

```bash
beeai ui
```

This opens your browser to [http://localhost:8333](http://localhost:8333) where you can browse and run available agents.

## What You'll See

### Agent Types

1. **Chat Agents**: Conversational interfaces
2. **Task Agents**: Single-purpose tools for specific jobs

### What's Hidden

The web interface only shows agents with proper user interfaces. Agents without UIs are hidden from the GUI but remain available through the command line.

**Why?** This keeps the interface clean for business users while developers can still access everything via CLI during development.

## Using the Interface

1. **Browse Agents**: View available agents
2. **Select an Agent**: Click to open its interface  
3. **Provide Input**: Interact with agents
4. **Get Results**: View outputs and download files as needed

## Q&A

**Q: Why don't I see all the agents from `beeai list`?**  
A: The web interface only shows agents designed for end users. Developers can access all agents via CLI.

**Q: How do I add an agent to the web interface?**  
A: Agents need UI metadata to appear. See the [Build Agents](/how-tos/build-agents) guide for developers.
