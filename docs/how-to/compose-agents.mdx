## GUI
The compose playground provides a visual interface for creating and running multi-agent compositions. Today, we have sequential composition which is powered by the sequential-workflow agent.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Launch the web interface">
        ```sh
        beeai ui
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Navigate to the compose playground">
    </Step>
    <Step title="Compose agents">
        - Add agents to your workflow by selecting them from the available list.
        - Arrange them in the desired execution order.
        - For each agent, specify the instructions that describe what it should do.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run your workflow">
        Click the **Run** button to execute the composition.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## CLI

You can compose agents directly from your terminal by running the sequential-workflow agent.

```sh
beeai run sequential-workflow '{
  "steps": [
    {"agent": "first-agent", "instruction": "First step instructions"},
    {"agent": "second-agent", "instruction": "Second step instructions"}
  ]
}'
```
