## GUI

The graphical user interface (GUI) provides an intuitive way to launch and manage agents.

<Info>Not all agents support GUI interaction.</Info>

<Steps>

    <Step title="Launch the web interface">

```sh
beeai ui
```

    </Step>
    <Step title="Launch the agent">

    - Navigate to the **Agents** tab.
    - Select you desired agent.
    - Click the **Launch this agent** button.

    </Step>

</Steps>

## CLI

You can launch and interact with agents directly from your terminal using the command-line interface (CLI).

Basic syntax:

```sh
beeai run <agent_name>
```

<Tip>To list all available agents, run: `beeai list`.</Tip>

### Interactive interface

Agents that implement a [standardized interface](/concepts/agents#standardized-agent-interfaces) support interactive mode.

Example usage:

```sh
# Chat agents
beeai run chat

# Hands-off agents
beeai run gpt-researcher
```

### Simplified interface

Chat and hands-off agents support simplified invocation, accepting text part of an input as the first parameter:

```sh
# Chat agent example
beeai run chat "Hello"

# Hands-off agent example
beeai run gpt-researcher "Impact of climate change on global agriculture"
```

## ACP SDK

All agents available on the platform are ACP-compliant out of the box, enabling you to remotely interact with them through the [ACP SDK](https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev/python-sdk/client).

The BeeAI platform is an ACP server that allows you to easily discover and run agents programmatically via the SDK or REST endpoints.

Install the SDK via

```bash
uv add acp-sdk
```

Example usage:

```python
import asyncio

from acp_sdk.client import Client

async def client() -> None:
    async with Client(base_url="http://localhost:8333/api/v1/acp") as client:
        run = await client.run_sync(agent="aider", input="Create a python script that prints 'Hello, world!'")
        print(str(run.output[0]))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(client())
```


## BeeAI framework

The [BeeAI Framework](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-framework) provides advanced tools to build and manage agent-based applications.

Install it via:

```sh
uv add beeai-framework
```

Example usage:

```python
import asyncio
import json
from beeai_framework.agents.experimental.remote.agent import RemoteAgent


async def run():
    response = await RemoteAgent(
        url="http://localhost:8333/mcp/sse", agent_name="gpt-researcher"
    ).run("why is Nvidia stock going up?")

    print(json.loads(response.result.text))


def main():
    asyncio.run(run())
```

For more advanced examples, including partial updates and error logging, refer to the [BeeAI Framework repository](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-framework).
