Once you've discovered agents and configured your environment, running them is simple.

You can launch and interact with agents using the graphical interface or the command line. To open the GUI, run:

```bash
beeai ui
```

<Note>
Not all agents support GUI interaction.

## Quickstart Examples

<Accordion title="Chat Agent">
Start an interactive chat session:
```bash
beeai run chat
```

Or send a single message:
```bash
beeai run chat "Hello! How can you help me today?"
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="GPT Researcher">
```bash
beeai run gpt-researcher "Research the latest developments in quantum computing"
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Aider - Code Assistant">
```bash
beeai run aider "
Review this Python function and suggest improvements:

def calculate_fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return calculate_fibonacci(n-1) + calculate_fibonacci(n-2)
"
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Prompt Chaining: GPT Researcher -> Chat Agent">
```bash
beeai run gpt-researcher "Latest developments in renewable energy storage" | beeai run chat "Summarize this research in 3 key bullet points"
```
</Accordion>

## Input Options

<Note>
Different agents may have different input expectations. Always refer to the agent’s documentation via `beeai info <agent-name>` for guidance.
</Note>

### Interactive Mode

Opens a session where you can send multiple messages.

```bash
beeai run chat
```

### Direct Text Input

Run an agent with a single message or prompt.

```bash
beeai run gpt-researcher "Research the latest developments in quantum computing"
```

### Multi-line Input

Great for sharing code snippets.

```bash
beeai run aider "
Review this Python function and suggest improvements:

def calculate_fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return calculate_fibonacci(n-1) + calculate_fibonacci(n-2)
"
```

### File Input

Send the contents of a file as input to an agent.

```bash
beeai run chat < my_file.txt
```

### Pipe Between Agents

Send output from one agent into another.

```bash
beeai run gpt-researcher "Latest developments in renewable energy storage" | beeai run chat "Summarize this research in 3 key bullet points"
```

## Output Handling

### Save to File

Save the agent’s output to a file:

```bash
beeai run chat "Write a technical blog post about how large language models work" > ~/post.md
```

### Append to File

Append output to an existing file:

```bash
beeai run chat "Add a section on the challenges and limitations of large language models" >> ~/blog.md
```

<Tip>
Make sure the path points to an existing file.
