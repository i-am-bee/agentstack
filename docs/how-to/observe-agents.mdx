Agent Stack provides observability tools to monitor and debug your agents through logging, telemetry, and integration with external monitoring systems.

## View Agent Logs

Stream real-time logs from any running agent:

```bash
agentstack logs <agent-name>
```

What you'll see:

- Agent startup and initialization
- Request processing steps
- Error messages and stack traces
- Container lifecycle events

<Note>
  Logs are only available for managed (containerized) agents that are currently
  running.
</Note>

## Telemetry Collection

Agent Stack includes OpenTelemetry instrumentation to collect traces and metrics. Telemetry data helps with performance monitoring, error tracking, usage analytics, and debugging agent interactions.

### Default Configuration

By default, Agent Stack sends telemetry to:

- **Local Phoenix instance** (if running) for trace visualization

The telemetry includes:

- Platform version and runtime details
- Agent execution traces

## Integration with Phoenix

[Arize Phoenix](https://phoenix.arize.com/) provides visualization for OpenTelemetry traces from your agents.

<Warning>
  **Important License Notice**: Phoenix is disabled by default in Agent Stack. When
  you enable Phoenix, be aware that Arize Phoenix is licensed under the Elastic
  License v2 (ELv2), which has specific terms regarding commercial use and
  distribution. By enabling Phoenix, you acknowledge that you are responsible
  for ensuring compliance with the ELv2 license terms for your specific use
  case. Please review the [Phoenix
  license](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix/blob/main/LICENSE) before
  enabling this feature in production environments.
</Warning>

<Steps>
   <Step title="Install Arize Phoenix">

Install and start Phoenix using `agentstack platform start` command:

```sh
agentstack platform start --set phoenix.enabled=true
```

       You can run this even if your platform is already running without loosing data.

   </Step>
    <Step title="Check if Phoenix is running">
        Spinning up phoenix can take a while, even after the `platform start` will report success.
        Go to [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) and check if it's running. If not, please wait a few
        minutes or check your internet connection.
    </Step>
   <Step title="Run Agent with Phoenix Configuration">

Execute the following command to run an example chat agent:

```sh
agentstack run chat "Hello"
```

   </Step>
   <Step title="View Traces in Phoenix">
      Go to [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) in your browser and open the **default** project.
   </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Want richer trace detail? Use the
  [OpenInference](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference/) standard for
  custom instrumentation.
