## 🚀 Major Feature: Structured User Input

We've built a new extension to support structured user input via forms in the GUI.

### Key Functionality

- Agents can define structured input demands as the first message
- Agents can request structured data at any time during multi-turn conversations
- The extension supports basic form layout using columns and column spans
- We provide essential form components: TextField, DateField, FileField, MultiSelect, and more
- Check out [the documentation](https://docs.beeai.dev/build-agents/forms)

## 🔐 Sneak Peek: MCP OAuth Integration

**Secure authentication for Model Context Protocol servers**

We're actively developing comprehensive MCP OAuth integration to enable secure, authenticated access to MCP servers and their tools.

### What is MCP OAuth?

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Open standard for AI systems to interact with external tools and data sources
- **OAuth 2.1 Integration**: Secure authorization framework for MCP server authentication

This combination enables an excellent user experience, allowing tools to be enhanced with context provided by third parties authorized by the user via OAuth.

### Key Benefits

- **🔒 Enhanced Security**: Robust authentication and authorization for MCP resources
- **🚀 Seamless Integration**: Automatic client registration and token management
- **⚡ Developer Experience**: Simplified authentication flow for MCP tool access

### Current Status

**In Active Development** - This feature depends on broader adoption of the MCP OAuth specification in hosted MCP servers, particularly the dynamic client registration requirement.

**Multi-User Support**: Multiple users can build and manage their own agents independently


### ⚙️  Agent Installation via GUI
**One-click agent deployment from the platform interface**

- **Streamlined Setup**: Install agents with a single click, no CLI required
- **Multi-Tenant Ready**: Integrated with user authentication for secure agent management

### 🎛️  Agent Settings
**Runtime configuration for enhanced agent behavior**

- **Custom Parameters**: Configure agent behavior, thinking, and other settings per run
- **Dynamic Tuning**: Adjust agent performance based on specific use cases

### 🔐 Agent Secrets
**Secure API key management for agent tools**
