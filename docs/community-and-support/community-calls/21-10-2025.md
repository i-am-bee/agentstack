## 🚀 Session Histroy

You can now persist and retrieve full conversation history across sessions.

Previously, messages were only kept in memory, meaning once a session ended, the context was lost.

With the new Session History feature, all messages can now be stored in the `PlatformContextStore`, giving you a persistent, queryable record of your conversations.

### What this means

- Every message in a session can now be saved to the platform store.
- You can retrieve and replay the entire conversation at any time.
- The UI can fetch and display past conversations, enabling a continuous experience between user sessions.
- Checkout the thorough [documentation](https://docs.beeai.dev/build-agents/multi-turn)

## 🔐 Agent Secrets

You can now securely request and manage secrets from users through the A2A service dependency extension.

Think of cases where your agent needs an API key or other credentials. Instead of manually configuring these, your agent can now ask the user to provide them directly in the UI, safely and only when needed.

### How it works?

- Agents can declare required secrets that the user can provide before execution.
- Users can optionally provide or refuse the secret when prompted.
- Agents can delay secret requests until they’re absolutely necessary during the conversation.

## ⚙️ Agent Settings

You can now provide custom configuration options for your agents through the Settings A2A extension.

For example, a toggle to enable or disable thinking, you can now expose those settings directly in the BeeAI UI.


### How it works?

- Agents can define custom settings that are shown to users before or during a run.
- Users can tweak configuration values like toggles or enumerated values
- These zsettings are automatically passed to the agent at runtime, so you can adapt behavior on the fly.

## 🏗️ Server Side GitHub builds

You can now let the platform build your agent images directly from GitHub.

Previously, adding an agent required you to provide a pre-built and hosted Docker image. With the new version, you can simply link a GitHub repository containing a Dockerfile, and the platform will build and host the image for you inside the cluster automatically.


### What this means

- Provide a GitHub repo with a valid `Dockerfile`
- Your agent image is built server-side and made available directly in the cluster.
- This lays the foundation for the upcoming GitHub Agent import via GUI, arriving in the next release.
