## üõ†Ô∏è In Development: ACP + A2A Unification

Google's A2A Protocol has joined the Linux Foundation alongside ACP (Agent Communication Protocol).

### What This Means

Both protocols are working toward a unified agent communication standard.

### Our Role

Partnering with Google to improve A2A while positioning BeeAI Platform as the simple way to build A2A compatible agents.

Our plan is to introduce a developer-friendly wrapper that adds:
- Intuitive API with ACP-style decorators
- Seamless BeeAI Platform integration
- Rich UI components (trajectories, chat interfaces)
- Enhanced developer experience

So you get "A2A with the simplicity you expect from BeeAI"

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

### Now

- A2A agent support in BeeAI Platform
- Developer-friendly SDK wrapper

### Next

- Enhanced UI components (e.g., feedback mechanism)
- Better developer tooling
