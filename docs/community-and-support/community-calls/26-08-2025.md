### What This Means

- **Complete protocol unification** - All agents now use A2A as the primary communication standard
- **Enhanced compatibility** - Seamless integration with Google's A2A ecosystem

### Key Changes

- All core agents migrated to A2A protocol
- Updated UI components to work with A2A message structure
- Improved error handling and streaming capabilities
- Better developer experience with new SDK patterns

The BeeAI SDK has evolved from initial skeleton to a comprehensive development toolkit.

### New Capabilities

- **Platform API Integration** - Direct access to BeeAI platform services
- **MCP Extension Support** - Model Context Protocol compatibility
- **File Handling** - Built-in support for document processing
- **Rich Extensions** - Citation, trajectory, and UI components

- Optimize for your specific use case and budget

### UI Enhancements

- **Better Error Handling** - More informative error messages and recovery
- **Enhanced Chat Interface** - Improved streaming and message rendering
- **File Upload Support** - Dynamic UI components based on agent capabilities
- **Feedback Mechanism** - Thumbs up/down agent responses to capture user input
