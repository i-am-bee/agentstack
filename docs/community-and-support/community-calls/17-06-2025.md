## 🚀 Introducing Playground

### Why the change?

Previously, we had the Compose Playground integrated.

We wanted to streamline the experience and make it more flexible for future features.

### What’s new?

Playground is now a standalone GUI.

Allows us more room for experimentation and rapid iterations.

Cleaner separation between production tools and experimental workflows.

### How to access it:

CLI:

```bash
beeai playground
```

Web:

Simply navigate to: http://localhost:8333/playground

## ⏳ ACP Await supported in the CLI

### What is Await?

A feature of ACP enabling flow interventions:

The agent can pause and wait for input either from:

- A human operator
- An external system

Previously, when an agent raised Await, both CLI and GUI ignored it.

### What’s new?

You can now run agents that leverage Await in the CLI.

When Await is raised:

- The CLI prompts you for input.
- You can manually decide how to proceed.

Check BeeAI framework [`RequirementAgent`](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-framework/blob/3c8f314299ba80d54245999e212f86e43957007c/python/examples/serve/beeai_platform_await.py#L15) example that leverages the concept.

### Future of Await

First step — GUI support is coming soon!

---
## 📜 Documentation Updates

Fresh, simplified, and much more practical documentation!

### What’s included:

✅ Quickstart Guide

- Very quick, minimal, and non-verbose.
- Get you up and running fast.

✅ Detailed "How Tos"

Step-by-step guides covering:

- Implementing your agent
- Wrapping it into the platform
- Building the agent image
- Deploying to Kubernetes cluster

### Coming soon:

🚀 OpenShift Integration Guide

Smooth deployment process also for OpenShift users.

## 📂 File Uploads through Agent GUI

### What’s new?

Agents can now receive file uploads via the GUI interface.

The uploaded file becomes part of the conversation using `ACP` [MessagePart](https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev/core-concepts/message-structure)

- Contains `content_url` and `content_type`.
- Files are attached to the conversation context.

### Why is this important?

A prerequisite for advanced RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) scenarios.

Enables more sophisticated workflows that can utilize file content.

### Examples of use:

- 🔎 Summarize uploaded documents.
- 🧠 Extract information and feed it into your tools.
- 🛠️ Use files as part of advanced tool calling pipelines.

Use the uploaded files however your agent requires.

## ⚙️ Kubernetes backed architecture refactor

Complete architecture refactor — now fully backed by Kubernetes!

### Why the change?

- Smooth transition towards enterprise-ready deployments.
- Provides a more scalable, production-grade foundation for running your agents.
- Allows introduction of more services within the stack (MessageQueues, Databases...)

### Architectural Requirements

✅ Feature parity between:
- Local development experience
- Remote / production deployments

✅ Simplified future development & maintenance:
- One consistent architecture
- Strong emphasis testing & debugging

### Deployment made easy
- Provided Helm Chart for simple deployment to any Kubernetes cluster.
- Complete deployment guide available in the new documentation.

## 🚀 What’s Coming Next

Heavy focus on improving the Agent Try Experience

### UI Components
Agent builders will soon be able to easily leverage rich UI components. This simplifies building more interactive, user-friendly agents.

Some of the examples: Citations, Chain of thought log, File attachments...

### User Identity Support
Agents will soon have access to user identity context.

- Enables more personalized agent behavior.
- Opens door to user-specific data & flows.
