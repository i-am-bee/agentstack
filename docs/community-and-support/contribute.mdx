Welcome! We’re so glad you’re here. Whether you're fixing a typo, filing a bug, or building something brand new, your contributions help shape Agent Stack into something better for everyone.

Here’s a quick guide to help you get started.

## What We Value

Agent Stack is more than code - it’s a community of curious, collaborative people. We care about:
- Making real problems easier to solve
- Sharing early and learning together
- Designing tools that are easy to build on
- Keeping things kind, intentional, and inclusive

## Ways to Contribute

You don’t need to be an AI expert to help. Here’s how you can get involved:
- Use Agent Stack and tell us what works (and what doesn’t)
- Open an issue for bugs, questions, or new ideas
- Share feedback on discussions or pull requests
- Propose changes — small ones are just as helpful!
- Improve docs, clarify examples, or help others onboard

## How We Work

We’re async-friendly, open to feedback, and always learning. A few principles:
- Start small and share often
- Focus on the problem you’re solving, not just the code
- Give thoughtful feedback and expect the same in return
- Prioritize clarity, empathy, and user impact
