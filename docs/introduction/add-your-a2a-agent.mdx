Got an existing A2A agent? You can connect it to BeeAI instantly using the BeeAI A2A Proxy — a lightweight tool that bridges your agent and the BeeAI Platform.

No need to modify your agent’s code — just run one command and your agent will appear live in the BeeAI interface.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- A running A2A agent with a valid agent card at `/.well-known/agent-card.json`
- Node.js installed (for npx)
- Agent Stack running (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8333`)

### Connect Your Agent

1. **Start your A2A agent** and note its URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`)

2. **Run the proxy** pointing to your agent:
```bash
npx tomkis/beeai-a2a-proxy start http://localhost:8080
```

That's it! Your agent is now registered with BeeAI and accessible through the interface.

## How It Works

The proxy creates a bridge between your A2A agent and BeeAI by:

1. **Intercepting agent card requests** - Captures `/.well-known/agent-card.json` requests from any A2A client
2. **Adding AgentDetail extension** - Automatically injects the necessary [AgentDetail](/build-agents/agent-details) extension data that enables the agent to work within the BeeAI ecosystem
3. **Auto-registration** - Automatically registers the modified agent with the BeeAI platform, making it immediately available

<Note>
The proxy supports agents using `jsonrpc` and `http_json` transport protocols.
</Note>

## Configuration Options

### Custom Proxy Port

By default, the proxy runs on port 8000. To use a different port:
```bash
npx tomkis/beeai-a2a-proxy start http://localhost:8080 --port 4000
```

### Custom Platform URL

If your BeeAI platform is running on a different URL:
```bash
npx tomkis/beeai-a2a-proxy start http://localhost:8080 --platform-url http://localhost:9000
```

### Disable Auto-Registration

To run the proxy without automatically registering with BeeAI:
```bash
npx tomkis/beeai-a2a-proxy start http://localhost:8080 --auto-register false
```

### Custom Agent Details

You can customize the agent details extension data by providing a JSON file:
```bash
npx tomkis/beeai-a2a-proxy start http://localhost:8080 --custom-data ./my-agent-details.json
```

## Available Options

| Option | Alias | Description | Default |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `--port` | `-p` | Port to run the proxy server on | 8000 |
| `--auto-register` | `-a` | Enable/disable auto-registration with BeeAI | true |
| `--platform-url` | `-P` | Platform URL to register with | http://127.0.0.1:8333 |
| `--custom-data` | `-c` | Path to custom agent detail JSON file | - |

## Deploying to Production

The proxy is great for local development and testing. To deploy your agent to production, you'll need to:

1. Add the [AgentDetail extension](build-agents/agent-details) directly to your agent's code (the proxy won't be available in production)
2. Containerize your agent as a Docker image
3. Deploy it as a managed provider

See the [Agent Details](/build-agents/agent-details) documentation to learn how to add the required extension, and [Deploying Agents](/deploy-agents) for the full production deployment process.

## Next Steps

- **Test your agent** in the BeeAI interface at `http://127.0.0.1:8333`
- **Explore [extensions](/concepts/extensions)** to add UI enhancements and service integrations
- **Customize [agent details](/build-agents/agent-details)** to improve how your agent appears in the interface
- **Ready to deploy?** Check out [Deploying Agents](/deploy-agents) when you want to publish your agent
