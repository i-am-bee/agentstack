BeeAI can be installed and used locally through the BeeAI CLI. Internally, this creates an automatically managed virtual machine for running agents. We offer support for macOS, Linux and Windows.

<Warning>

BeeAI may not function properly on out-of-support operating systems, like macOS 12 or Windows 8.

<Step title="Install uv">

If you don't have `uv` installed, install it using one of the supported ways:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Installation script">

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Homebrew">

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
brew install uv
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>
</Step>
<Step title="Install BeeAI">

```bash
uv tool install beeai-cli
```

</Step>
<Step title="Start the BeeAI platform">

```bash
beeai platform start
```

</Step>
<Step title="Configure an LLM provider">

BeeAI needs an LLM provider for the agents -- like OpenAI, Ollama, Anthropic, etc.

If you don't already have an API key for a provider, you can register for a free one on [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/).

Run this command and follow the interactive prompts:

```bash
beeai env setup
```

<Tip>
You can re-run this command anytime to change the LLM provider.
</Tip>

</Step>
<Step title="Check that everything works">

```bash
beeai run chat Hi!
```

Starting up an agent for a first time may take a few minutes. If everything is succesful, you should see a friendly greeting from the agent.

✨ **Done!** You are ready to use the BeeAI platform.

<Tab title="Package manager">

Some Linux distributions package `uv`, but beware that some may include outdated versions.

Check the [Repology website](https://repology.org/project/uv/versions) to see if your distribution packages `uv`.

Alternatively, you may install `uv` using `pipx` or `cargo` according to the [official installation instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

If in doubt, just use the installation script.

</Step>
<Step title="Install QEMU">

Install QEMU according to the [official instructions](https://www.qemu.org/download/#linux).

<Note>
Alternatively, BeeAI platform can run using `docker`. In that case, QEMU is not needed. Runtime will be automatically detected.

<Step title="Install WSL2">

If you don't already use [WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), install it:

1. Open PowerShell or Command Prompt as Administrator
2. Run the WSL installation command:

```bash
wsl --install
```

3. Restart your computer when prompted
4. After restart, a terminal window will open to complete the WSL2 Ubuntu installation
5. You will be prompted to create a username and password

</Step>
<Step title="Configure WSL2 networking">

In order for the agents to be able to auto-register and access [Ollama for Windows](https://ollama.com/download/windows), it's necessary to configure the WSL2 networking to a mirrored mode:

1. Run this command in PowerShell to open a configuration file:
   
   ```bash
   notepad $HOME\.wslconfig
   ```

2. Confirm creation of the file if prompted, and insert the following lines:

   ```ini
   [wsl2]
   networkingMode=mirrored
   ```

3. Restart WSL by running in PowerShell:

   ```bash
   wsl --shutdown
   ```

</Step>
<Step title="Install a container runtime">

Install one of the following container runtimes. Leave installation options at their default values (use WSL2, use `dockerd` runtime).

- [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) ✨ recommended
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/)

</Step>
<Step title="Install uv">

You may install the BeeAI CLI directly in Windows (PowerShell), or in the Ubuntu (WSL2) shell. You can even do both, it's up to your preference.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="PowerShell">

Open PowerShell and run:

```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Ubuntu (WSL2) shell">

First configure your container runtime to be accessible from WSL2:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Rancher Desktop">

1. Open Rancher Desktop
2. Go to Preferences > WSL Integration
3. Enable integration for your Ubuntu WSL2 distro

</Tab>
<Tab title="Docker Desktop">

1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Go to Settings > Resources > WSL Integration
3. Enable integration for your Ubuntu WSL2 distro

</Tab>
<Tab title="Podman Desktop">

For Podman Desktop, follow the [documentation for socket forwarding to WSL2](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/podman/accessing-podman-from-another-wsl-instance).

</Tab>
</Tabs>

Ensure that `docker` works in WSL2 by running the following in the Ubuntu (WSL2) shell:
```bash
docker ps
```

Finally, install `uv` with:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Step title="Install BeeAI">

```bash
uv tool install beeai-cli

<Step title="Start the BeeAI platform">

```bash
beeai platform start
```
