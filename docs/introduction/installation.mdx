The BeeAI platform supports installation on **macOS** and **Linux** using multiple methods.

<Info>Windows support will be available in the next `Alpha` release.</Info>

## Homebrew (recommended)

Installing using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is the recommended method for both macOS and Linux. It handles dependency installation and manages background services automatically.

### Install

```sh
brew install i-am-bee/beeai/beeai
brew services start beeai
```

### Update

<Note>Agents are updated automatically.</Note>

```sh
brew upgrade beeai
brew services restart beeai
```

### Uninstall

```sh
brew services stop beeai
brew uninstall beeai
```

## PyPI

This Python-native installation method is less recommended because it requires additional manual steps and does not manage dependencies or background services automatically.

### Install

<Warning>
  This installation method is unsupported. We strongly recommend using the
  [Homebrew method](#homebrew-recommended).
</Warning>

<Steps>
   <Step title="Install pipx">

Follow the official instructions to install [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx).

   </Step>
   <Step title="Install BeeAI">

```sh
pipx install beeai-cli
```

   </Step>
   <Step title="Install agent runtimes">

These are optional, but you won't be able to use agents, including built-in ones, if the corresponding runtime is not available.

    - **Python runtime**: Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
    - **JavaScript/TypeScript runtime**: Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
    - **Docker runtime**: This is optional since currently no built-in agents require Docker. If desired, we recommend [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/).

    </Step>
    <Step title="Run BeeAI server:">

You need to keep this command running in order to use the platform.

```sh
beeai serve
```

   </Step>
</Steps>

### Update

```sh
pipx upgrade beeai
```

### Uninstall

```sh
pipx uninstall beeai
```

## What's next?

After installation, configure your API keys with the following command:

```sh
beeai env setup
```

Then, verify your setup by running:

```sh
beeai provider list
```

Ensure all providers display the `ready` state. Note that initial setup might take a few minutes.

You may also wish to enable [Agent Traceability](/observability/agents-traceability).
