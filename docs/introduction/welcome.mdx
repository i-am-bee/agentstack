## What is BeeAI?

BeeAI is the first open platform built on the [Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)](https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev/) — the open standard for AI agent interoperability. As the reference implementation of ACP, BeeAI showcases how agents built on different frameworks can seamlessly communicate, no matter their underlying technology stack.

With ACP at its core, BeeAI makes it easy to:
- **Discover** agents across a wide range of frameworks via our growing catalog  
- **Run** agents locally using your preferred LLM provider  
- **Orchestrate** agents into workflows — regardless of how or where they were built
