description: "Discover, run, and share agents from any framework"
---

BeeAI is an open-source platform that makes it easy to **discover**, **run**, and **share** AI agents across frameworks. Built on the [Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)](https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev/) and hosted by the Linux Foundation, BeeAI bridges the gap between different agent ecosystems.

## The Problem BeeAI Solves

Teams trying to operationalize AI agents face three critical challenges:
- **Framework Fragmentation:** Different frameworks create silos and duplicated efforts
- **Deployment Complexity:** Each agent requires its own setup, limiting scalability
- **Discovery Challenges:** No central hub exists for finding and using available agents

BeeAI provides a standardized platform to discover, run, and share agents from any framework - for both individuals and teams.

## For Individual Developers

BeeAI makes it easy to experiment with agent capabilities on your own machine:

- **Try agents** instantly from the community catalog without complex setup
- Use **standard interfaces** that create consistent user experiences
- **Package existing agents** from any framework using standardized containers
- **Share agents** with others through a consistent protocol

## For Teams

As you scale from personal experimentation to team adoption, BeeAI grows with you:
- **Deploy a centralized BeeAI instance** that the entire team can access
- Create a **team catalog** where developers publish and end users discover agents
- **Standardize agent interfaces** for consistent user experiences
- **Centrally manage** LLM connections to control costs and access

## Key Features

| Feature | How It Works | Business Value |
| :------ | :----------- | :------------- |
| **Agent Catalog** | One BeeAI platform serves your entire team | Everyone works from the same system with unified management |
