BeeAI CLI can be used to quickly set up a local instance of the BeeAI platform, including a web interface for interacting with agents.

## Pre-requisites

- familiarity with running commands in terminal
- API key for an LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, watsonx, ...)
    - free API keys can be obtained from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) or [Groq](https://groq.com/)
    - alternatively, [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) can be used to run local LLMs, but this requires a very powerful computer
- _(recommended)_ fast internet connection (a few GB will be downloaded)

## Installation

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Linux & macOS (script)">

Open the terminal and run this command to install BeeAI:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/i-am-bee/beeai-platform/refs/heads/main/install.sh)"
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Linux & macOS (manual)">
If you prefer to install BeeAI manually, follow these steps:
- Install `uv` for your platform (installable via `brew`, `pipx`, `cargo`, or via the [installation instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)).
- _(Linux only)_ Install QEMU using your distribution's package manager (see [installation instructions](https://www.qemu.org/download/)).
- Open a new terminal and run:
```bash
uv tool install --refresh --quiet --force beeai-cli && beeai self install
```
- Follow the interactive prompts to finish installation and setup.

<Warning>

Windows / WSL support is currently experimental. We recommend running BeeAI on Linux or macOS instead.

</Warning>
<Steps>
<Step title="Update Windows">

Ensure that you are using **Windows 11 22H2** or newer.

</Step>
<Step title="Install uv">

If you don't have `uv` installed, install it using one of the supported ways.

Open PowerShell and run:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Installation script (recommended)">

```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Winget">

```bash
winget install astral-sh.uv
uv tool update-shell
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Scoop">

```bash
scoop install uv
uv tool update-shell
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Chocolatey">

```bash
choco install uv
uv tool update-shell
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

After this, close the terminal and re-open it.

</Step>
<Step title="Install BeeAI">

```bash
uv tool install --refresh --quiet --force beeai-cli && beeai self install
```

Follow the interactive prompts to finish the installation and setup.

## First steps

### Starting the BeeAI platform

During installation, the BeeAI platform is started automatically. If you skipped that step, start the platform using `beeai platform start`.

You will need to start the platform each time you restart your computer. The data is stored locally and persistently. To stop the platform while preserving data, run `beeai platform stop`. To delete the platform and all its data, run `beeai platform delete`.

### Setting up a LLM provider

Agents in BeeAI usually need API access to a Large Language Model (LLM) provider. During installation, you were prompted to set up a provider. If you skipped that step, or want to use a different provider, you can set it up now using `beeai model setup`.

<Tip>
Don't have an API key? You can get free API keys from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) or [Groq](https://groq.com/).
</Tip>

### Running your first agent

Let's be polite and start with a greeting:

```bash
beeai run chat Hi!
```

Running this command may take a while, as the agent starts up for the first time. If everything is configured correctly, you should see a friendly response.

Other basic CLI commands include:

```sh
# List all available agents
beeai list

# Run an agent interactively
beeai run chat

# Run an agent with direct input
beeai run chat "Hello! How are you?"

# Get agent details and parameters
beeai info chat

# View all CLI options
beeai --help
```

### Using the web UI

BeeAI also provides a web-based user interface for interacting with agents, which you can start using `beeai ui`.

The web UI is intentionally simplified for end-users who need basic agent interactions without CLI complexity. Think of the web UI as a deployment target for your agents, not your primary development environment.

## Upgrading

Check what version of BeeAI you are running using:

```bash
beeai self version
```

If a newer version is available, upgrade using:

```bash
beeai self upgrade
```

<Info>
This command will install the latest stable version of BeeAI CLI and also update the BeeAI platform instance.
</Info>

## Uninstallation

Uninstall BeeAI CLI and platform using the following steps:

```bash
beeai self uninstall
```

<Info>
This command will remove the BeeAI platform instance and all its data, as well as the BeeAI CLI itself.
