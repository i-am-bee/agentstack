<Steps>
<Step title="Install BeeAI">

Install BeeAI using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (recommended for macOS and Linux)

```sh
brew install i-am-bee/beeai/beeai
beeai platform start
```

</Step>
<Step title="Configure your LLM provider"> 
   
```sh
beeai env setup
```

</Step>
<Step title="Start with the CLI (Primary Interface)">

Get familiar with the core commands:

```sh
# List all available agents
beeai list

# Run an agent interactively
beeai run chat

# Run an agent with direct input
beeai run chat "Hello! How are you?"

# Get agent details and parameters
beeai info chat

# View all CLI options
beeai --help
```

</Step>
<Step title="Check out the Web Interface">

```sh
beeai ui
```

**Note:** The web UI is intentionally simplified for end-users who need basic agent interactions without CLI complexity. Think of the web UI as a deployment target for your agents, not your primary development environment.
