---

BeeAI CLI can be used to quickly set up a local instance of the BeeAI platform, including a web interface for interacting with agents.

**Pre-requisites:**
- familiarity with running commands in terminal
- API key for an LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, watsonx, ...)
    - free API keys can be obtained from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) or [Groq](https://groq.com/)
    - alternatively, [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) can be used to run local LLMs, but this requires a very powerful computer
- _(recommended)_ fast internet connection (a few GB will be downloaded)

<Step title="Install uv">

If you don't have `uv` installed, install it using one of the supported ways.

Open a terminal and run:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Installation script (recommended)">

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Homebrew">

```bash
brew install uv
uv tool update-shell
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

After this, close the terminal and re-open it.

</Step>
<Step title="Install BeeAI">

```bash
uv tool install beeai-cli
```

<Info>

See bottom of this page for instructions on updating and uninstalling.

</Info>

</Step>
<Step title="Start the BeeAI platform">

```bash
beeai platform start
```

<Info>

This step downloads a few gigabytes of data, so it may take a while depending on your internet connection. Once started, the platform will continue running in the background until you stop it with `beeai platform stop` or shut down your computer.

</Info>

</Step>
<Step title="Configure an LLM provider">

If you don't already have an API key for an LLM provider, register for a free one on [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) or [Groq](https://groq.com/).

Run this command and follow the interactive prompts:

```bash
beeai model setup
```

<Info>

You can re-run this command anytime to change the LLM provider.

</Info>

</Step>
<Step title="Check that everything works">

```bash
beeai run chat Hi!
```

Starting up an agent for the first time may take a few minutes. If everything is successful, you should see a friendly greeting from the agent.

</Step>
<Step title="Try the web interface">

```bash
beeai ui
```

<Info>

The web UI is intentionally simplified for end-users who need basic agent interactions without CLI complexity. Think of the web UI as a deployment target for your agents, not your primary development environment.

</Info>

</Step>
<Step title="Get familiar with the CLI">

```sh
# List all available agents
beeai list

# Run an agent interactively
beeai run chat

# Run an agent with direct input
beeai run chat "Hello! How are you?"

# Get agent details and parameters
beeai info chat

# View all CLI options
beeai --help
```

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Package manager">

Some Linux distributions package `uv`, but beware that some may include outdated versions.
Check the [Repology website](https://repology.org/project/uv/versions) to see if your distribution packages `uv`.
Alternatively, you may install `uv` using `pipx` or `cargo` according to the [official installation instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
If in doubt, just use the installation script.

After installing `uv`, run this to update your PATH:

```bash
uv tool update-shell
```

After this, close the terminal and re-open it.

Windows / WSL support is currently experimental. We recommend running BeeAI on Linux or macOS instead.

These steps guide you through installing BeeAI in PowerShell. If you wish, you may work in a WSL distribution instead. In that case, simply switch to the Linux instructions and skip installing QEMU.

<Step title="Upgrade BeeAI">

```bash
uv tool install --force beeai-cli

<Tip>
We recommend this command over `uv tool upgrade beeai-cli` to ensure that you always get the latest version. `uv tool upgrade` respects the original version constraint -- e.g. if you installed with `uv tool install beeai-cli==0.3.2`, `uv tool upgrade beeai-cli` will never upgrade to `0.3.3` or later.
