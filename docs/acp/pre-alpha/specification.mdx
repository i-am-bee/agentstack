<Warning>
  Fundamental breaking changes are happening now, affecting protocol, transport,
  and APIs. Consider this version experimental. Join [Alpha
  discussions](/acp/alpha/architecture#discussions) to help shape it.
</Warning>

The pre-alpha version of the Agent Communication Protocol is built on top of the [Model Context Protocol](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io). It extends the [MCP specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/) with **agents** capability on the server side. The agents capability gives the client the means to discover and run agents.

## Capabilities

Servers that support agents **MUST** declare the agents capability:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "agents": {}
  }
}
```

# Protocol Messages

## Listing Agents

To discover available agents, clients send a `agents/list` request.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "agents/list",
  "params": {}
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "agents": [
      {
        "name": "gpa",
        "description": "General purpose agent",
        "inputSchema": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "text": {
              "type": "string"
            }
          },
          "required": ["text"]
        },
        "outputSchema": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "text": {
              "type": "string"
            }
          },
          "required": ["text"]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Running Agents

To run an agent, clients send a `agents/run` request.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "agents/run",
  "params": {
    "name": "gpa",
    "input": {
      "text": "Howdy!"
    }
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "result": {
    "output": {
      "text": "Howdy back at ya!"
    }
  }
}
```

The definition of input and output schemas is **NOT** part of the specification. Clients **SHOULD NOT** expect any specific schema for an agent prior to discovery through the `agents/list` response.

### Progress

When a client wants to receive progress updates during a run, it **MUST** include a `progressToken` as defined in [MCP specification](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/utilities/progress/). The server then **MAY** send agent progress notifications throughout the run.

**Notification:**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "notifications/agents/run/progress",
  "params": {
    "progressToken": "abc123",
    "delta": {
      "text": "Howd"
    }
  }
}
```

The `delta` is a subset of the `outputSchema`. The sequence of deltas **SHOULD** constitute the final output when joined using the following algorithm.

#### Delta Algorithm

The rules for applying a `delta` to an existing in-progress `output` JSON are as follows, where `output + delta => new_output` denotest the combining operation:

- Different types can't be combined.

```
1 + ["hello"] => ERROR
```

- Numbers combine by addition.

```
1 + 2 => 3
```

- Strings combine by concatenation.

```
"hello" + "there" => "hellothere"
```

- Objects combine by merging and combining values in common keys.

```
{a: 1, b: "hello"} + {b: "world", c: 2} => {a: 1, b: "helloworld", c: 2}
```

- Combining a value with `null` results in the value.

```
value + null => value
null + value => value
```

- Combining an empty array with an another array results in the another array.

  - **Exception:** When `output` is `[] | null | undefined` and the first element of `delta` is `null`, it is dropped. This is to ensure that appending to an array can be done without the knowledge of whether the array is currently empty or not.

```
array + [] => array
[] + array => array
[] + [null, "general", "Kenobi"] => ["general", "Kenobi"]
```

- Non-empty arrays combine by combining the last element of `output` array with the first element of `delta` array, and appending the rest of the elements.

```
["hello", "there"] + ["general", "Kenobi"] => ["hello", "theregeneral", "Kenobi"]
["hello", "there"] + [null, "general", "Kenobi"] => ["hello", "there", "general", "Kenobi"]
[] + ["general", "Kenobi"] => ["general", "Kenobi"]
[] + [null, "general", "Kenobi"] => ["general", "Kenobi"]
```
