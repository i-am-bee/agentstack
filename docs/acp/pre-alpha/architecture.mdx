<Warning>
  Fundamental breaking changes are happening now, affecting protocol, transport,
  and APIs. Consider this version experimental. Join [Alpha
  discussions](/acp/alpha/architecture#discussions) to help shape it.
</Warning>

The **Agent Context Protocol (ACP)** extends the Model Context Protocol (MCP) by introducing the concept of **agents**, enabling more dynamic and modular interactions.

## Client-Server Architecture

ACP maintains the fundamental client-server architecture from MCP, allowing clients to interact with multiple servers seamlessly.

- **Hosts**: Applications or environments (IDEs, development tools, AI systems) that utilize ACP to access data and services through agents. A good example of a host is BeeAI UI, which can be invoked with the command `beeai ui`.
- **Clients**: Protocol clients maintaining direct connections with ACP servers, exchanging requests and responses via [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org).
- **Servers**: Servers providing specialized capabilities via agents, responding to client requests, and managing interactions with local or remote data sources.

## Core Components

### Protocol Layer

ACP utilizes [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification), a standardized protocol for invoking remote server functions using JSON messages. JSON-RPC is specifically designed for Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). It defines message formats and request-response handling, explicitly making it a Layer 7 protocol.

JSON-RPC message example:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "methodName",
  "params": {
    /* parameters */
  }
}
```

ACP inherits the [message types from MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture#message-types):

- **Requests**: Expect responses from servers or agents.
- **Results**: Responses indicating successful handling of requests.
- **Notifications**: One-way messages for updates or event reporting.
- **Errors**: Standardized error reporting with clear codes and descriptive messages.

### Communication Layer

<Note>
  We are implementing a support for natural language interaction with agents in
  [ACP Alpha](/acp/alpha).
</Note>

The Communication Layer provides optional schemas for JSON-RPC communication. Agents are not required to strictly adhere to these schemas but, if adopted, can leverage built-in UI components, simplified composition patterns, and better interoperability across ACP-enabled tools and systems.

        class MessageOutput(Output):
            messages: list[Message]
        ````
    </Accordion>

### Transport Layer

This layer manages how JSON-RPC messages are physically exchanged. Supported transport methods include:

- **HTTP with Server-Sent Events (SSE)** (preferred): Optimal for remote transfer.
- **Stdio**: Optimal for local process communication.
- **WebSockets** (under development): Optimal for bi-directional remote communication.

## ACP in OSI Model

The following example illustrates where ACP fits within the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. This is a simplified representation showcasing the recommended usage of ACP through HTTP with SSE.

Both ACP and JSON-RPC operate above the Application layer, as they manage higher-level interactions.
