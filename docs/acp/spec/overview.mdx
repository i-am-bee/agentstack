This repo contains the specification of Agent Connect Protocol (ACP)

Agent Connect Protocol defines a standard interface to invoke and configure agents.

â€‹The Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) is a standardized interface designed to facilitate seamless interaction among AI agents, regardless of their underlying technology stacks. As the landscape of AI agents expands, the necessity for a unified communication framework becomes increasingly evident. ACP addresses this need by providing a common protocol that enables agents to collaborate effectively, fostering interoperability across diverse platforms and frameworks.

The motivation behind ACP stems from the challenges observed in the current ecosystem, where agents often operate in isolation, each with its own custom interface. This fragmentation hampers the potential for agents to work collectively, limiting their ability to perform complex tasks that require cooperation. By adopting ACP, developers can create agents that not only function independently but also integrate seamlessly into multi-agent systems, enhancing their utility and applicability across various domains.

ACP is built upon the principles of simplicity and generality, ensuring that it can be adopted by any agent, irrespective of the framework or technology used. This approach promotes a more cohesive and efficient ecosystem, where agents can discover, compose, deploy, and evaluate workflows collaboratively. The protocol defines a set of standardized endpoints and response models, facilitating consistent communication patterns among agents.

In summary, the Agent Communication Protocol serves as a foundational element in the development of an open and interoperable Internet of Agents. By standardizing the way agents communicate, ACP paves the way for more dynamic and collaborative AI systems, ultimately accelerating innovation and productivity across industries.
