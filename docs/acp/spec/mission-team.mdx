## Mission

Our mission is to democratize AI through the development of a standardized communication protocol. We envision a future where local, remote, and open-source agents can seamlessly operate and communicate across any machine or platform.

We believe AI technologies hold transformative potential for society but recognize that their impact has often been limited by complexity and barriers to accessibility. By eliminating these technological hurdles, we aim to make AI universally accessible, enabling communities everywhere to harness its benefits for societal advancement and technological breakthroughs.

Ultimately, our goal is to leverage AI as a catalyst for positive global change, bridging gaps and ensuring equitable access to technological innovations.

## Team
