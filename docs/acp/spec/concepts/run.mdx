## Motivation

Agents may, or may not, hold some internal state. It's easy to imagine an I/O agent that accepts some input data, does some LLM crunching, and returns the output. However, there are many types of agents where it's desirable to continue the interaction further, for example ask it for refinements, or even interactively collaborate on some task.

With a classic LLM, the usual way of interaction is to send the full message history with each request. This is a sort of "client-stored state" -- given that the LLM has no other thoughts, tool outputs, running processes etc. to keep track of, the full interaction can be represented by the message history, and thus the LLM itself may pretend to be "stateless" while actually offloading the state management to the API user.

One advantage the classic "client-stored state" is the ability to "go back in history" and re-do an interaction, perhaps try a different message, or simply re-roll the LLM answer in hopes of getting better results. However, this approach stops being viable as soon as we introduce agentic tools. Try any commercial "chat with LLM" application that supports a persistent code interpreter, and you'll discover that rolling back the message history is just an illusion and the code intepreter retained its state, as code can't be easily un-executed.

For this reason, ACP uses a concept of "agent runs", which are representations for state that is held server-side, and is non-rollbackable. What may seem like a limitation over the commonly used paradigm is actually just acceptance of the wide agentic reality -- in most cases, it's difficult to serialize agent state, almost impossible to roll it back, and in many cases undesirable to expose it to the client.

## How Agent Runs Work In ACP

ACP offers the resource "Agent Run" for managing agent states. Agent Runs can be initiated by `POST /runs`, resumed by `POST /runs/{run_id}`, and cancelled by `/runs/{run_id}/cancel` (note that ACP does not use DELETE here since cancellation is an asynchronous operation).

For different types of agents, an Agent Run may mean different things:

- **Stateless agents** don't support holding a conversation, thus the Agent Run represents only a single call and its result.
- **Serializable stateful agents** can save their state to a persistent storage, allowing for the Agent Run to continue virtually anytime.
- **Non-serializable stateful agents** depend on a non-serializable resource, like a running Jupyter kernel, and thus their Agent Run has a short expiration time -- _expired_ Agent Run can't be continued further.

From the point of agent implementation, most of the heavy lifting around state management is handled by the SDK. The agent creator / integrator must only decide what typ of statefulness is right for the given agent, and properly wire it to the agent implementation: creating a new instance or retrieving an existing one where appropriate.

### Run states

Each Agent Run starts in the `created` state. After receiving input, it moves to the `in-progress` state. While in-progress, the agent can optionally await some external input, in which case it goes to `awaiting` and returns back to `in-progress` after receiving the input. After a successful execution, `in-progress` turns into a terminal state `completed`. A run that's `in-progress` or `awaiting` can be cancelled, in which case it first goes to `cancelling` and then a terminal state `cancelled`. Finally, an error may occur, in which case the agent state becomes a terminal state `failed`.

Depending on agent implementation, the run could be continued, in which case it may return to the `in-progress` state from one of the terminal states.
