## Design Principles

ACP design is guided by the following core principles:

- **Unopinionated**: No assumptions about frameworks, agent implementations, or agent states.
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Simple initial use, incrementally supporting advanced scenarios.
- **Simplicity**: Clear, straightforward, and intuitive by design.
- **Flexibility**: Easily adaptable across various use cases.
- **Design-led**: Driven by intuitive design rather than extensive documentation.
