ACP supports both synchronous (send a request and wait for the response) and asynchronous (send a request, receive an identifier, and query results later) modes of interaction.

To learn how asynchronous requests can be implemented, see [POST /runs](/acp/spec/run-create) and [GET /runs/\{run_id\}](/acp/spec/run-get).
