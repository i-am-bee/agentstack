ðŸ’¬ Discussion: [Support for Stateful Agents](https://github.com/orgs/i-am-bee/discussions/322)

ACP supports both **stateless** and **stateful** agents. The simplest agent implementations are stateless. Stateful agents, however, maintain context across interactions using sessions.

ACP does not prescribe any specific approach to how state is created or managed. This responsibility lies entirely with the agent author. Additionally, the ACP design does not inherently suggest agents should support traversing historical states.

The concept of sessions in ACP is similar to browser sessions, facilitating context maintenance between interactions.

Please see [POST /runs](/acp/spec/run-create) to learn how sessions are passed during runs.

## Docs Under Construction!

We're actively working on enhancing this documentation. Check back soon for updates!

## Coming soon:

- Mutability vs. Immutability
- Considerations when writing stateful agents
- Naming rationale: choosing `session_id` vs `thread_id`
