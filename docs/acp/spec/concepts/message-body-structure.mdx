This page describes the core "message body" structure used in ACP.

## Introduction

A message body consists of a series of parts, which may be "text", "image", or "artifact", like int this example:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "text",
    "content": "This is a cute cat:"
  },
  {
    "type": "image",
    "contentUrl": "https://s3.example.com/12345678901234567890/image.png"
  },
  {
    "type": "text",
    "content": "Would you like me to send more images of cats?"
  },
  {
    "type": "artifact",
    "name": "/sources/1",
    "contentUrl": "https://example.com/cat-facts"
  }
]
```

- `"text"` parts provide their `content` inline
- `"image"` parts provide a `contentUrl` where the content can be retrieved
- `"artifact"` parts either provide a `contentUrl` like images, or they can be inlined by defining `content`, `contentType` (MIME type), and `contentEncoding` (which may be `"plain"` or `"base64"`)

Parts form a full message by interleaving textual content with images and artifacts (which may serve as attachments, sources, recorded tool calls, etc.).

Next we provide a more formal specification of this structure, accompanied by more examples.

## `MessageBody`

`MessageBody` consists of parts, each representing either text, an image, or an artifact. Text parts contain inline content, while images reference external content via a URL. Artifacts can either reference external content via a URL or contain inline content with an encoding. Only artifacts have names.

A message is an ordered list of parts. Text and images typically represent the main content, while artifacts serve as attachments, metadata, or additional resources.

```ts
interface MessageBodyPart {
    type: "text" | "image" | "artifact";
} & ({
    type: "text";
    content: string;
} | {
    type: "image";
    contentUrl: string;
} | {
    type: "artifact";
    name: string;
} & ({
    contentUrl: string;
} | {
    content: string;
    contentType?: string;
    contentEncoding: "plain" | "base64";
}))

type MessageBody = MessageBodyPart[];
```

## `MessageBodySchema`

`MessageBodySchema` defines the types of parts expected in a message. It is simply a list of supported types from the set `["text", "image", "artifact"]`. A message is valid if all its parts are of a type listed in the schema.

```ts
type MessageBodySchema = ("text" | "image" | "artifact")[];
```

## Examples

### Chat agent

A simple chat agent that only supports text responses:

```json
["text"]
```

Example message:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "text",
    "content": "Hello, world!"
  }
]
```

### Multi-modal chat agent

A chat agent that can send text and images:

```json
["text", "image"]
```

Example message:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "text",
    "content": "This is a cute cat:"
  },
  {
    "type": "image",
    "contentUrl": "https://s3.example.com/12345678901234567890/image.png"
  },
  {
    "type": "text",
    "content": "Nice, huh?"
  }
]
```

### Software-writing agent

An agent that generates text responses along with downloadable files:

```json
["text", "artifact"]
```

Example message:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "text",
    "content": "I have created a hello world project in Python."
  },
  {
    "type": "artifact",
    "name": "/files/hello_world.py",
    "contentUrl": "https://s3.example.com/12345678901234567890/hello_world.py"
  }
]
```

### Researcher agent

An agent that provides a detailed write-up with images and references:

```json
["text", "image", "artifact"]
```

Example message:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "text",
    "content": "Cats are known to be [cute](source:1) and [funny](source:2)."
  },
  {
    "type": "image",
    "contentUrl": "https://s3.example.com/12345678901234567890/cat.png"
  },
  {
    "type": "artifact",
    "name": "/sources/1",
    "contentUrl": "https://example.com/cat-facts"
  },
  {
    "type": "artifact",
    "name": "/sources/2",
    "content": "https://example.com/it-came-to-me-in-a-dream",
    "contentEncoding": "plain"
  }
]
```

## Why keep it simple?

Many schema formats, such as JSON Schema, introduce unnecessary complexity. This proposal keeps the structure minimal while still covering most use cases efficiently.
