description: "Configure how your agent appears and behaves in the GUI"
---

When building your agent, you can configure certain attributes that affect how it appears and behaves in the user interface. The `@server.agent` decorator accepts a `detail` parameter with an `AgentDetail` object that controls the visual representation and behavior in the UI.

You can customize various aspects of your agent's presentation, such as:
- The type of user interface the agent uses (chat, form, etc.)
- Custom user greetings
- Metadata about tools the agent provides
- Author and contributor information
- License, framework, and source code details

## Basic Configuration

Configuring agent details is straightforward. Import `AgentDetail` and related types, then pass them to the `detail` parameter in the `@server.agent` decorator:
```python
import os

from a2a.types import Message
from agentstack_sdk.server import Server
from agentstack_sdk.server.context import RunContext
from agentstack_sdk.a2a.extensions import AgentDetail, AgentDetailContributor, AgentDetailTool

server = Server()

@server.agent(
    name="Example Research Assistant",
    detail=AgentDetail(
        interaction_mode="multi-turn", # or single-turn
        user_greeting="Hi there! I can help you research topics or summarize uploaded documents.",
        tools=[
            AgentDetailTool(
                name="Web Search",
                description="Looks up recent and relevant information from the web."
            ),
            AgentDetailTool(
                name="Document Reader",
                description="Reads and extracts key insights from uploaded PDFs or text files."
            ),
        ],
        framework="BeeAI Framework",
        author={
            "name": "Agent Stack Team",
            "email": "team@example.com",
        },
        source_code_url="https://github.com/example/example-research-assistant",
    ),
    skills=[
        AgentSkill(

                and summarizes findings in clear, useful responses.

            ),
            tags=["Search", "Knowledge"],
            examples=[

                "Give me an overview of current space exploration missions.",
            ],
        ),
        AgentSkill(
            id="summarization",
            name="Summarization",
            description=dedent(
                """\
                Reads and summarizes uploaded text or documents, highlighting the 
                most important ideas, statistics, and conclusions.
                """
            ),
            tags=["Documents", "Summaries"],
            examples=[
                "Summarize this PDF report about electric vehicle trends.",
                "What are the main points from this research article?",
                "Condense this document into a short summary I can share.",
            ],
        ),
    ],
)
async def example_agent(input: Message, context: RunContext):
    """An example agent with detailed configuration"""
    yield "Hello World!"

def run():
    server.run(host=os.getenv("HOST", "127.0.0.1"), port=int(os.getenv("PORT", 8000)))
