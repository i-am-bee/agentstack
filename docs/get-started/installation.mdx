## Install the BeeAI platform

The BeeAI platform can be installed on Mac or Linux. We support multiple installation methods:

---

Install using **[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)** (recommended): A cross-platform package manager for Linux and Mac. This method will install all dependencies for you, as well as manage background services.

1. If you don't already use Homebrew, install it using the instructions [provided on the homepage](https://brew.sh/).
2. Install BeeAI with:
    `brew install i-am-bee/beeai/beeai && brew services start beeai`
3. (optional) Install the [Arize Phoenix](https://phoenix.arize.com/) UI with:
    `brew install i-am-bee/beeai/arize-phoenix && brew services start arize-phoenix`
4. Installation complete! Move to the next section to set up agent providers.

---

Install from **PyPI**: Python-native way of installing. This method is less preferred since it requires more manual steps to complete.

1. Install [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) from your OS's package manager (`sudo apt install pipx`, `sudo dnf install pipx`, `sudo pacman -S python-pipx`, ...)
    - _Alternative_: You may create a virtual Python environment and use regular `pip` instead. In that case, be aware that BeeAI will be available only in the virtual environment you use.
    - _Alternative_: If you are a user of `uv`, you may use `uv tool install ...` instead of `pipx install ...`.
2. Install BeeAI with:
    `pipx install beeai-cli`
3. (optional) Install the [Arize Phoenix](https://phoenix.arize.com/) UI with:
    `pipx install arize-phoenix`
4. Install agent runtimes. These are optional, but you won't be able to use agents, including built-in ones, if the corresponding runtime is not available.
    - _Python_: BeeAI uses [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage Python environments. Install `uv` using your OS's package manager, or follow the [official installation instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
    - _JavaScript / TypeScript_: BeeAI uses `npx`, part of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), to manage JS/TS environments. Install `node` using your OS's package manager, or follow the [official installation instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
    - _Docker_: (optional: no built-in agents use this runtime) BeeAI uses the `docker` CLI to manage agent containers. If you are unsure how to setup a container runtime on your machine, we recommend [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/).
5. Open a new terminal window and run `beeai serve`. This will start the BeeAI service, and show you the logs. Keep this terminal window running in order to use the platform.
6. (optional) Open a new terminal window and run `PHOENIX_GRPC_PORT=8336 phoenix serve` to run the Arize Phoenix UI. Also keep this terminal window open and running.
7. Installation complete! Move to the next section to set up agent providers.

## Set up agent providers

After installation, it's time to set up the agent providers.

Run `beeai provider list` and check that all of the providers are in the `ready` state. It might take a while the first time. Repeat `beeai provider list` to see the current status.

Some of the providers may require additional environment variables, like API keys. Provide them with `beeai env add VARIABLE=VALUE`.

## Visit the UI
