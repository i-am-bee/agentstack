---

The BeeAI platform can be installed on Mac or Linux. We support two installation methods: through Homebrew (on both Mac and Linux), and also from PyPI.

We **recommend [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)** since it supports background service management -- you won't need to keep the server running in a terminal window. This applies to both Mac and Linux.

### Homebrew

Homebrew itself can be installed using the installation script provided on the [homepage](https://brew.sh/).

Install BeeAI CLI with:

```sh
# run once to install
brew install i-am-bee/beeai/beeai
# run once to enable service
brew services start beeai
```

If you want Arize Phoenix, install it with:

```sh
# run once to install
brew install i-am-bee/beeai/arize-phoenix
# run once to enable service
brew services start arize-phoenix
```

The services for `beeai` and `arize-phoenix` will continue to run in the background and restart with your device. Run `brew services list` to see their status.

To open the web interfaces, visit:

* BeeAI: `http://localhost:8333`

* Arize Phoenix: `http://localhost:6006`

### PyPI

BeeAI can alternatively be installed as a Python package from PyPI. While you may install using `pip` in a separate virtual environment, we recommend using [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/) to make `beeai` command globally available on your machine. `pipx` is readily available from most package managers (`apt`, `dnf`, `brew` etc.).

Install BeeAI CLI with:

```sh
# run once to install
pipx install beeai-cli
# keep running in a separate terminal
beeai serve
```

If you want Arize Phoenix, install it with:

```sh
# run once to install
pipx install arize-phoenix
# keep running in a separate terminal
phoenix serve
```

With this installation method, the BeeAI (and Phoenix) services won't be automatically started and managed. You will need to keep `beeai serve` (and optionally `phoenix serve`) running in a separate terminal in order to use the platform.

To open the web interfaces, visit:

* BeeAI: `http://localhost:8333`

* Arize Phoenix: `http://localhost:6006`

## Development setup

### Installation

This project uses [Mise-en-place](https://mise.jdx.dev/) as a manager of tool versions (`python`, `uv`, `nodejs`, `pnpm` etc.), as well as a task runner and environment manager. Mise will download all the needed tools automatically -- you don't need to install them yourself.

Clone this project, then run these setup steps:

```sh
brew install mise # more ways to install: https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html
mise trust
mise install
```

After setup, you can use:

* `mise run` to list tasks and select one interactively to run

* `mise <task-name>` to run a task

* `mise x -- <command>` to run a project tool -- for example `mise x -- uv add <package>`

> \[!TIP]
> If you want to run tools directly without the `mise x --` prefix, you need to activate a shell hook:\* Bash: `eval "$(mise activate bash)"` (add to `~/.bashrc` to make permanent)\* Zsh: `eval "$(mise activate zsh)"` (add to `~/.zshrc` to make permanent)\* Fish: `mise activate fish | source` (add to `~/.config/fish/config.fish` to make permanent)* Other shells: [documentation](https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html#shells)

### Configuration

Edit `[env]` in `mise.local.toml` in the project root ([documentation](https://mise.jdx.dev/environments/)). Run `mise setup` if you don't see the file.

### Running

To run BeeAI components in development mode (ensuring proper rebuilding), use the following commands.

#### Server

```sh
# remove existing providers (due to breaking changes during rapid development)
rm -f ~/.beeai/providers.yaml

# API
mise beeai-server:run
# (keep it running, open another terminal for next steps)
```

#### CLI

```sh
# add official framework provider 
mise beeai-cli:run -- provider add file://agents/official/beeai-framework/beeai-provider.yaml

# tools
mise beeai-cli:run -- tool list
mise beeai-cli:run -- tool call fetch '{"url": "http://iambee.ai"}'

# agents
mise beeai-cli:run -- agent list
mise beeai-cli:run -- agent run website_summarizer "summarize iambee.ai"
```

#### UI

```sh
# run the UI development server:
mise beeai-ui:run

# UI is also available from beeai-server (in static mode):
mise beeai-server:run
```
