## Installation

The BeeAI CLI can be installed through Homebrew (on both Mac and Linux), and also from PyPI.

We **recommend Homebrew** since it supports background service management -- you won't need to keep the server running in a terminal window.

### Homebrew

Install BeeAI CLI with:

```sh
brew install i-am-bee/beeai/beeai # run once to install
brew services start beeai # run once to enable service
```

If you want Arize Phoenix, install it with:

```sh
brew install i-am-bee/beeai/arize-phoenix # run once to install
brew services start arize-phoenix # run once to enable service
```

The services for `beeai` and `arize-phoenix` will continue to run in the background and restart with your device. Run `brew services list` to see their status.

### PyPI

<Note>
    We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) or
    [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/) to make beeai command globally available on your machine.
    Please follow their installation instructions.
</Note>

Install BeeAI CLI with:

```sh
uv tool install beeai-cli # run once to install
beeai serve # keep running in a separate terminal
```

If you want Arize Phoenix, install it with:

```sh
uv tool install arize-phoenix # run once to install
phoenix serve # keep running in a separate terminal
```

This variant does not manage background services -- the `beeai serve` and `phoenix serve` commands need to be kept running in order to use the platform.
