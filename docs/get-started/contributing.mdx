This document is useful for **contributors** to the BeeAI platform. If you want to use the platform, follow the [installation instructions](/get-started/installation) instead.

## Development setup

### Installation

This project uses [Mise-en-place](https://mise.jdx.dev/) as a manager of tool versions (`python`, `uv`, `nodejs`, `pnpm` etc.), as well as a task runner and environment manager. Mise will download all the needed tools automatically -- you don't need to install them yourself.

Clone this project, then run these setup steps:

```sh
brew install mise # more ways to install: https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html
mise trust
mise install
```

After setup, you can use:

* `mise run` to list tasks and select one interactively to run

* `mise <task-name>` to run a task

* `mise x -- <command>` to run a project tool -- for example `mise x -- uv add <package>`

If you want to run tools directly without the `mise x --` prefix, you need to activate a shell hook:

* Bash: `eval "$(mise activate bash)"` (add to `~/.bashrc` to make permanent)

* Zsh: `eval "$(mise activate zsh)"` (add to `~/.zshrc` to make permanent)

* Fish: `mise activate fish | source` (add to `~/.config/fish/config.fish` to make permanent)

* Other shells: [documentation](https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html#shells)

### Configuration

Edit `[env]` in `mise.local.toml` in the project root ([documentation](https://mise.jdx.dev/environments/)). Run `mise setup` if you don't see the file.

### Running

To run BeeAI components in development mode (ensuring proper rebuilding), use the following commands.

#### Server

```sh
# remove existing providers (due to breaking changes during rapid development)
rm -f ~/.beeai/providers.yaml

# API
mise beeai-server:run
#Â (keep it running, open another terminal for next steps)
```

#### CLI

```sh
# add official framework provider 
mise beeai-cli:run -- provider add file://agents/official/beeai-framework/beeai-provider.yaml

# tools
mise beeai-cli:run -- tool list
mise beeai-cli:run -- tool call fetch '{"url": "http://iambee.ai"}'

# agents
mise beeai-cli:run -- agent list
mise beeai-cli:run -- agent run website_summarizer "summarize iambee.ai"
```

#### UI

```sh
# run the UI development server:
mise beeai-ui:run

# UI is also available from beeai-server (in static mode):
mise beeai-server:run
```
