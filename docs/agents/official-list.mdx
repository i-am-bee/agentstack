## Agents

The following is a list of the official agents:

| Name | Framework | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [agent-docs-creator](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai/blob/main/agents/official/agent-docs-creator) | BeeAI | The agent analyzes AI source code to generate structured, clear, and complete documentation in a consistent template, supporting multiple languages. |
| [chat](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai/blob/main/agents/official/beeai-framework/src/chat) | BeeAI | The agent is an AI-powered conversational system with memory, supporting real-time search, Wikipedia lookups, and weather updates through integrated tools.
 |
| [content-judge](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai/blob/main/agents/official/beeai-framework/src/content-judge) | BeeAI | Evaluates multiple documents and agent-generated content based on correctness, depth, clarity, and relevance, selecting the highest-scoring one. It ensures optimal document quality for research, content validation, and knowledge refinement. |
| [podcast-creator](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai/blob/main/agents/official/beeai-framework/src/podcast-creator) | BeeAI | The agent creates structured podcast-style dialogues optimized for AI-driven text-to-speech (TTS). It formats natural conversations with a lead speaker and an inquisitive co-host, ensuring realistic interruptions and follow-ups. The output is structured for seamless TTS integration. |
| [sequential-workflow](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai/tree/main/agents/official/composition/src/composition/sequential_workflow.py) | - | The agent executes a sequence of AI agents in a defined workflow, transforming and routing outputs from one agent to the next. |
| [prompted-sequential-workflow](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai/tree/main/agents/official/composition/src/composition/prompted_sequential_workflow.py) | - | Executes a sequence of text-processing agents, each with specific instructions. |
| [supervisor](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai/blob/main/agents/official/beeai-supervisor/src/supervisor/supervisor.ts) | - | A supervisor agent that autonomously decomposes complex tasks, assigns them to the most suitable agents, and orchestrates execution within a multi-agent system. It iteratively evaluates results, determines follow-up tasks, and dynamically adapts workflows until an optimal solution is reached before responding to the user. |
