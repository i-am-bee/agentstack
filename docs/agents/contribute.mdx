To contribute your own agent, you can easily get started in two ways:

1. **Reach out to us on Discord:**  
  Join our Discord community to discuss your ideas, ask questions, or get help from maintainers and fellow contributors. It's a great way to collaborate and quickly validate your approach.

2. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**:  
  If you already have something prepared, feel free to open a PR directly in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai/tree/main/agents/official). Our maintainers will review your submission and guide you through any necessary adjustments.

We welcome contributions from everyone and appreciate your support in improving our agent ecosystem!
