## Development setup

### Installation

This project uses [Mise-en-place](https://mise.jdx.dev/) as a manager of tool versions (`python`, `uv`, `nodejs`, `pnpm`
etc.), as well as a task runner and environment manager. Mise will download all the needed tools automatically -- you
don't need to install them yourself.

Clone this project, then run these setup steps:

```sh
brew install mise # more ways to install: https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html
mise trust
mise install
```

After setup, you can use:

* `mise run` to list tasks and select one interactively to run

* `mise <task-name>` to run a task

* `mise x -- <command>` to run a project tool -- for example `mise x -- uv add <package>`

If you want to run tools directly without the `mise x --` prefix, you need to activate a shell hook:

* Bash: `eval "$(mise activate bash)"` (add to `~/.bashrc` to make permanent)

* Zsh: `eval "$(mise activate zsh)"` (add to `~/.zshrc` to make permanent)

* Fish: `mise activate fish | source` (add to `~/.config/fish/config.fish` to make permanent)

* Other shells: [documentation](https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html#shells)

### Configuration

Edit `[env]` in `mise.local.toml` in the project root ([documentation](https://mise.jdx.dev/environments/)). Run
`mise setup` if you don't see the file.

### Running the platform from source

Starting up the platform using the CLI (`beeai platform start`, even `mise beeai-cli:run -- platform start`) will use
**published images** by default. To use local images, you need to build them and import them into the platform.

Instead, use:

```shell
mise beeai-platform:start
```

This will build the images (`beeai-server` and `beeai-ui`) and import them to the cluster. You can add other
CLI arguments as you normally would when using `beeai` CLI, for example:

```shell
mise beeai-platform:start --set docling.enabled=true
```

To stop or delete the platform use

```shell
mise beeai-platform:stop
mise beeai-platform:delete
```

For debugging and direct access to kubernetes, setup `KUBECONFIG` and other environment variables using:

```shell
# Activate environment
eval "$(mise run beeai-platform:shell)"

# Deactivate environment
deactivate
```

### OAuth/OIDC authentication for local testing

By default, authentication and authorization are disabled.

Starting the platform with OIDC enabled:

```bash
mise beeai-platform:start --set oidc.enabled=true
```

This does the following:
- Installs Istio in ambient mode.  
- Creates a gateway and routes for `https://beeai.localhost:8336/`.  
- Installs the Kiali console.  

**Why TLS is used:**  
OAuth tokens are returned to the browser only over HTTPS to avoid leakage over plain HTTP. Always access the UI via `https://beeai.localhost:8336/`.

**OIDC configuration:**  
Configure your OIDC provider to allow `https://beeai.localhost:8336/` as a redirect URI.  
When deploying to a cloud cluster, adjust `nextauth_url` and `nextauth_redirect_proxy_url` to match your domain. Some providers require a valid top-level domain for redirect URIs.

**Istio details:**  
The default namespace is labeled `istio.io/dataplane-mode=ambient`. This ensures all intra-pod traffic is routed through `ztunnel`, except the `beeai-platform` pod, which uses `hostNetwork` and is not compatible with the Istio mesh.

**Available endpoints:**

| Service        | HTTPS                                      | HTTP                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Kiali Console  | –                                          | `http://localhost:20001`            |
| BeeAI UI       | `https://beeai.localhost:8336`             | `http://localhost:8334`             |
| BeeAI API Docs | `https://beeai.localhost:8336/api/v1/docs` | `http://localhost:8333/api/v1/docs` |


### Running and debugging individual components

It's desirable to run and debug (i.e. in an IDE) individual components against the full stack (PostgreSQL,
OpenTelemetry, Arize Phoenix, ...). For this, we include [Telepresence](https://telepresence.io/) which allows rewiring
a Kubernetes container to your local machine. (Note that `sshfs` is not needed, since we don't use it in this setup.)

```sh
mise run beeai-server:dev:start
```

This will do the following:

1. Create .env file if it doesn't exist yet (you can add your configuration here)
2. Stop default platform VM ("beeai") if it exists
3. Start a new VM named "beeai-local-dev" separate from the "beeai" VM used by default
4. Install telepresence into the cluster
   > Note that this will require **root access** on your machine, due to setting up a networking stack.
5. Replace beeai-platform in the cluster and forward any incoming traffic to localhost

After the command succeeds, you can:

- send requests as if your machine was running inside the cluster. For example:
  `curl http://<service-name>:<service-port>`.
- connect to postgresql using the default credentials `postgresql://beeai-user:password@postgresql:5432/beeai`
- now you can start your server from your IDE or using `mise run beeai-server:run` on port **18333**
- run beeai-cli using `mise beeai-cli:run -- <command>` or HTTP requests to localhost:8333 or localhost:18333
    - localhost:8333 is port-forwarded from the cluster, so any requests will pass through the cluster networking to the
      beeai-platform pod, which is replaced by telepresence and forwarded back to your local machine to port 18333
    - localhost:18333 is where your local platform should be running

To inspect cluster using `kubectl` or `k9s` and lima using `limactl`, activate the dev environment using:

```shell
# Activate dev environment
eval "$(mise run beeai-server:dev:shell)"

# Deactivate dev environment
deactivate
```

When you're done you can stop the development cluster and networking using

```shell
mise run beeai-server:dev:stop
```

Or delete the cluster entirely using

```shell
mise run beeai-server:dev:delete
```

> TIP: If you run into connection issues after sleep or longer period of inactivity
> try `mise run beeai-server:dev:reconnect` first. You may not need to clean and restart
> the entire VM

#### Developing tests

We use a separate VM for local development of e2e and integration tests, the setup is almost identical,
but you need to change kubeconfig location in your .env:

```shell
# Use for developing e2e and integration tests locally
K8S_KUBECONFIG=~/.beeai/lima/beeai-local-test/copied-from-guest/kubeconfig.yaml
```

and then run `beeai-server:dev:test:start`

> TIP: Similarly to dev environment you can use `mise run beeai-server:dev:test:reconnect`

<details>
<summary> Lower-level networking using telepresence directly</summary>

```shell
# Activate environment
eval "$(mise run beeai-server:dev:shell)"

# Start platform
mise beeai-cli:run -- platform start --vm-name=beeai-local-dev # optional --tag [tag] --import-images
mise x -- telepresence helm install
mise x -- telepresence connect

# Receive traffic to a pod by replacing it in the cluster
mise x -- telepresence replace <pod-name>

# More information about how replace/intercept/ingress works can be found in the [Telepresence documentation](https://telepresence.io/docs/howtos/engage).
# Once done, quit Telepresence using:
```sh
mise x -- telepresence quit
```

</details>

#### Ollama

If you want to run this local setup against Ollama you must use a special option when setting up the LLM:

```
beeai env setup --use-true-localhost
```

### Working with migrations

The following commands can be used to create or run migrations in the dev environment above:

- Run migrations: `mise run beeai-server:migrations:run`
- Generate migrations: `mise run beeai-server:migrations:generate`
- Use Alembic command directly: `mise run beeai-server:migrations:alembic`

> NOTE: The dev setup will run the locally built image including its migrations before replacing it with your local
> instance. If new migrations you just implemented are not working, the dev setup will not start properly and you need
> to fix migrations first. You can activate the shell using `eval "$(mise run beeai-server:dev:shell)"` and use
> your favorite kubernetes IDE (e.g., k9s or kubectl) to see the migration logs.

### Running individual components

To run BeeAI components in development mode (ensuring proper rebuilding), use the following commands.

#### Server

Build and run server using setup described in [Running the platform from source](#running-the-platform-from-source)
Or use development setup described
in [Running and debugging individual components](#running-and-debugging-individual-components)

#### CLI

```sh
mise beeai-cli:run -- agent list
mise beeai-cli:run -- agent run website_summarizer "summarize iambee.ai"
```

#### UI

```sh
# run the UI development server:
mise beeai-ui:run

# UI is also available from beeai-server (in static mode):
mise beeai-server:run
```

## Releasing

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**   
> Always create pre-release before the actual public release and check that the upgrade and installation work.

Use the release script:

```shell
mise run release
```
